#  Cybersecurity & Networking (CN) Portfolio - WTAMU MS-CISBA Capstone

This folder contains the final deliverables that demonstrate my evolution of skills in the Cybersecurity & Networking (CN) area of the MS-CISBA program. The work included reflects concepts learned in CIDM 6340 and CIDM 6356 and illustrates my understanding of securing systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and applying cybersecurity principles to real-world environments.
