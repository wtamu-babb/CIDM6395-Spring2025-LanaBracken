The Offer


Direct link to offer
 (incognito)




Chase is offering a checking & savings bonus worth up to $900. Bonus is as follows:



Receive a bonus of $300 when you open a Chase Total checking account and have a direct deposit post to the account within 90 days.


Receive a bonus of $200 when you open a Chase savings account and deposit $15,000 or more in new money within 30 days and maintain a balance of $15,000 for 90 days.


Receive an extra $400 bonus when you complete both of the above bonuses.










The Fine Print




Checking offer is not available to existing Chase checking customers. Savings offer is not available to existing Chase savings customers. Both offers are not available to those whose accounts have been closed within 90 days or closed with a negative balance within the last 3 years.


You can receive only one new checking and one new savings account opening related bonus every two years from the last coupon enrollment date and only one bonus per account. Coupon is good for one-time use.


To receive the checking bonus: 1) Open a new Chase Total Checking account, which is subject to approval; AND 2) Have your direct deposit made to this account within 90 days of coupon enrollment. Your direct deposit needs to be an electronic deposit of your paycheck, pension or government benefits (such as Social Security) from your employer or the government. Person to Person payments (such as Zelle®) are not considered a direct deposit. (Micro-deposits do not qualify as a direct deposit for the bonus. Micro-deposits are small deposits, typically less than $1, that are sent to your account to verify it is the correct account.)


After you have completed all the above checking requirements, we’ll deposit the bonus in your new account within 15 days. To receive the savings bonus: 1) Open a new Chase SavingsSM account, which is subject to approval; 2) Deposit a total of $15,000 or more in new money into the new savings account within 30 days of coupon enrollment; AND 3) Maintain at least a $15,000 balance for 90 days from the coupon enrollment. The new money cannot be funds held by you at Chase or its affiliates.


After you have completed all the above savings requirements, we’ll deposit the bonus in your new account within 15 days.


To receive the extra bonus: You must open the checking and savings account at the same time and complete all requirements above for BOTH the checking bonus and savings bonus. After you have completed all requirements, we will deposit the remaining bonus due in your new account within 15 days.


To receive any of the above bonuses, the enrolled account must not be closed or restricted at the time of payout. Eligibility may be limited based on account ownership. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for Chase SavingsSM, effective as of 12/29/2022, is 0.01% for all balances in all states. Interest rates are variable and subject to change. Additionally, fees may reduce earnings on the account.


Bonuses are considered interest and will be reported on IRS Form 1099-INT (or Form 1042-S, if applicable).




Avoiding Fees


Savings Account


The Chase Savings Account comes with a monthly service fee of $5. Monthly fee is waived with any ONE of the following:




Keep a minimum daily balance of $300 or more


Have 
at least one
 repeating automatic transfer from your Chase checking account of $25 or more; one time transfers do not qualify


Have a linked Chase Premier Plus Checking, Chase Premier Platinum Checking, or Chase Private Client Checking account




New accounts will not be charged a Monthly Service Fee for at least the first two statement periods.


Checking Account


The Chase Total Checking account comes with a monthly service fee of $10-$12 which is waived if complete any of the following:




Have monthly direct deposits totaling $500 or more


Keep a minimum daily balance of $1,500 or more in the checking account


Keep an average daily balance of $5,000 or more in any combination of qualifying Chase checking, savings and other balances














New accounts will not be charged a Monthly Service Fee for at least the first two statement periods.


Early Account Termination Fee


There used to be an six-month period where you would lose the bonus if closed out, but sometime in 2022 (?) they removed that clause and so it’s now safe to close after you receive the bonus paid out.


Our Verdict


This is the best public bonus we’ve seen on this account, really excellent offer and much better than 
the prior $600 offer
.


Those who have done a Chase bonus before can do it again after 24 months. Look for the opening date of when you opened your last checking/savings accounts (not the bonus date), then wait 24 months before opening the new account. That will make you eligible for the new bonus.

Update 7/14/23:
 A bunch of readers report getting this offer again – it was just sent out as a targeted email offer.


Update 4/30/23:
 There are a couple of data points indicating that the $900 promo code will still work beyond the 4/19/23 expiration date. There is no link to generate new codes, but if you already have a code you can applying it and see if the Chase system accepts it. YMMV. (ht

Have combined monthly direct deposits totaling $1,000 or more


Keep a minimum average account balance of $1,500 or more

Be a military member (requires self disclosure)


Be under the age of 24 or over the age of 65




Early Account Termination Fee


There is no early account termination fee to worry about


Our Verdict


Not as good as the recent $500 bonus unfortunately
. That being said this bonus is churnable (can’t have had an account within the past 12 months) meaning it’s probably worth resetting that clock as soon as possible rather than waiting for a marginally bigger bonus to potentially return. Because of that we will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

Wells Fargo is offering a $2,500 bonus when you open or upgrade a Wells Fargo Premier relationship.



Open a new Premier Checking account at a Wells Fargo branch with a minimum opening deposit of $25 by April 1, 2023. You must provide the bonus offer code to the banker at the time of account opening.


Bring $250,000 or more in new deposits to qualifying linked accounts by Day 45 and maintain at least a $250,000 balance through Day 90 after account upgrade or opening.










The Fine Print




Offer available to customers 1) upgrading an existing Wells Fargo consumer checking account to a Wells Fargo Premier Checking account, or 2) opening a new Premier Checking account.


You must use your bonus offer code at the time of account upgrade or new Premier Checking account opening.


Only one $2,500 bonus may be applied per upgraded account or new Premier Checking account. Limit one bonus per customer.


You are not eligible for this offer if: You have received a bonus for opening a Wells Fargo 
Premier
 Checking account within the past 12 months or if you are a Wells Fargo employee.


Bonus Requirements: To receive the $2,500 bonus, you must: Upgrade to a Premier Checking account or open a new Premier Checking account by April 1, 2023 AND Bring $250,000 or more in new deposits to qualifying linked accounts by Day 45 and maintain at least a $250,000 balance through Day 90 after account upgrade or opening.


Qualifying linked accounts include (a) bank deposit account balances (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC-insured IRAs) and (b) investment account balances
 (brokerage available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors, and eligible foreign exchange transactions). Excludes applicable bank fiduciary and custody accounts, and annuities.



Wells Fargo Advisors: Brokerage products and services are offered through Wells Fargo Advisors. Wells Fargo Advisors is a trade name used by Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (WFCS) and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC, Members SIPC, separate registered broker-dealers and non-bank affiliates of Wells Fargo & Company. Certain brokerage accounts are not eligible.






We will deposit your bonus into your Premier Checking account within 30 days after you have met all offer requirements.


The Premier Checking account must be open at the time we attempt to deposit any earned bonus payment. Please note that an account with a zero balance may be closed by us without prior notice, as further described in the Deposit Account Agreement.


Interest on the Premier Checking account is compounded daily and paid monthly. The amount of interest earned is based on the daily collected balances in the account. The following Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of November 25, 2022. The account pays an APY of 0.25% if the balance is $0–$99,999.99 and 0.50% if the balance is $100,000 or more. Rates are variable and subject to change without notice. Fees could reduce earnings on this account.


Offer expires April 1, 2023. However, this offer may be discontinued or changed at any time prior to the expiration date without notice.


Offer cannot be:



Paid without a valid U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number (Form W-9 for U.S. persons including a resident alien). Non-resident aliens signing Form W-8 are not eligible for the offer.


Combined with any other consumer deposit offer (limit one bonus per customer).
 If your existing Wells Fargo checking account is enrolled with a bonus offer pending, this bonus will be forfeited once upgrading to a Premier Checking account for purposes of this upgrade bonus offer.


Reproduced, purchased, sold, transferred, or traded.






The actions required to earn this bonus are separate and distinct from the options available to you to avoid any applicable monthly service fee for the checking account you upgraded to.


You are responsible for any federal, state, or local taxes due on the bonus and we will report as income to the tax authorities if required by applicable law (form 1099). Consult your tax advisor.




Avoiding Fees


The Premier Checking account has a $35 monthly service fee. The fee can be avoided each fee period with $250,000 or more in statement-ending qualifying linked (a) bank deposit account balances (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC-insured IRAs) and (b) investment account balances.


Initial monthly service fee waiver
: We’ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.












Regarding investing: it looks like there is a
 $49.95 (
pdf
)when you transfer out all of your investments and terminate your account. I suppose you can just leave there $1 indefinitely to avoid this fee (?). (See 
this link
 > “account maintenance fees”.) (Some readers say you need to leave at least $95 or maybe $125 in order to avoid the fee.)


Our Verdict


Since this offer is available for both new accounts and upgrades, the best play here would be to
 open a new Wells Fargo ordinary checking account online and get a $325 bonus with $1,000 direct deposit
. Then (
after the bonus posts
), go to a Wells Fargo branch and upgrade to a Premier relationship. Then, sometime in the next 45 days, transfer over $250,000 in cash or assets and leave it there until day 90. The fine print seems clear that you can get the Premier offer so long as you have not done a Premier checking offer in the past 12 months, even if you did a standard checking offer in the past 12 months. Just 
be aware
 that Wells bonuses take a full 90 days to post, so you’re risking the $2,500 offer expiring while you wait for the $325 to post.


The Wells Fargo Premier checking account
 earns an interest rate of .01%.


It looks like Wells Fargo has a self-directed investment option
, and you can ACAT transfer over any ETFs (and possibly mutual funds) from another brokerage, and that would work toward the $250,000 qualifier. You can also buy U.S. Treasuries, brokered CDs, or other safe mutual funds which would earn top interest rates as well, see our post: 
Utilizing Money Market Funds & Treasury Bills For Brokerage Bonuses.
 Some suggest WMPXX. And I believe some have reported getting confirmation that retirement investing accounts can work to meet the $250,000 requirement as well.


Let’s break down the math for those who want to do this bonus with a cash transfer and for those who want to use the Wells Fargo investment arm:




Cash Deposit Option
: deposit $250,000 in cash for around 46 days. Let’s just round it up and say you’re money will be in transit for 2 months, you’ll still be getting around 6% return for those two months, plus the regular .50% interest. That’s a solid couple percentage points above what you’d earn from 
a regular high interest savings account
. You might get stuck with a $35 fee for the the final month after you transfer out your balances back to your regular high yield savings account and before you manage to close the account. It’s possible you can do the whole thing without getting hit with any fees, and you’ll end up with maybe ~$800 more than you’d have gotten 
from a bank account which earns 4.50% APY
.


Investment Deposit Option
: I have no experience with Wells Fargo investing, but hopefully you can easily move over your ETF investments and easily earn the $2,500 without much work. Or you can move cash into your Wells brokerage account and buy up money market funds that will earn around the same amount as a high yield savings account. Again, you’ll net the full $2,500 bonus without any trade-offs. 
(Just be sure
 to deposit more than $250,000 of investments in case the assets lose value and your balance dips below $250k.)

Possibly you’ll get hit with one $35 fee on your way out. And then there’s also the above-mentioned 
 $49.95 ACAT-out fee if you transfer out all of your investments. 
You need to make sure your investment accounts are linked to Premier Checking




Separately, there’s also now
 a $525 Wells Fargo in-branch savings bonus
 as well. 
Multiple 
readers
 heard from their banker that the $25k won’t stack with the $250k offer. In reality it 
probably will stack
.


We’ll add this to our list of 
Best Bank Bonuses
 and 
Best Brokerage Bonuses
. 
If you did this bonus before and are doing it again,
 you can use the same brokerage account as the first time
.  It’s just the checking account that needs to be closed and then opened again in branch with the banker applying the promo code to the new checking account. 
Some suggest
 waiting 3 months after closing before opening again.

The Offer












Direct link to offer




First Tech Federal Credit Union is offering a bonus $300 when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Set up a new payroll direct deposit to your First Tech Rewards Checking of $5,000+ per month for a minimum of three months










The Fine Print




Offer valid for enrollment between February 26, 2024 and June 30, 2024 for members without an existing direct deposit.


Members with existing direct deposits or who are already enrolled in a First Tech direct deposit campaign are not eligible.


Participant is defined as 18 years of age or older and the primary account owner on a First Tech Rewards Checking (FTRC) account.


Direct deposits are considered new if there has been no direct deposit activity in the Participant’s share accounts on which they are the Primary Owner within the previous 18 months.


New Direct Deposit Offer: New direct deposit must occur at least on New Direct Deposit Offer: New direct deposit must occur at least once per calendar month from the Participant’s employer payroll into the First Tech Rewards Checking (FTRC) account of which the Participant is the primary account owner. Direct deposits from a non-employer payroll source do not qualify. The monthly aggregate amount of all qualifying direct deposits must equal to at least $1,000 to earn the $300 bonus. Enrollment is the date of the initial direct deposit transaction. During the period of time commencing with Enrollment and ending 120 calendar days after Enrollment (“Enrollment Period”), at least one direct deposit transaction must occur each calendar month starting with the initial direct deposit transaction. A minimum of three direct deposit transactions must be received during the Enrollment Period. (EXAMPLE: If a member’s initial direct deposit is March 1, 2024, additional required direct deposits must occur at least once in each subsequent calendar month following the month in which the initial direct deposit is made, the last direct deposit must be received by June 29, 2024.) Only the Participant will receive credit for the direct deposits. Any qualifying bonus will be deposited to the Participant’s Membership Savings account the first week following the Enrollment Period. Bonuses will be considered dividends and may be reported on IRS form 1099-INT.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


No early account termination fee
. They have a $5 inactivity fee after 6 months. Need to have transactions or more than $500 in deposits.


Our Verdict


Previously there was a $350 bonus
, but this required $1,500 in spend in three categories to get $150 of the bonus. I think this flat $300 bonus is much better and worth doing and we will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Bank of America is offering a $300 bonus when you open a new eligible checking account and complete the following requirements:



Set up and receive Qualifying Direct Deposits of $2,000 or more into that account within 90 days of account opening




















 


 


The Fine Print




This offer is available online only and may not be available if you leave this page, visit bankofamerica.com, visit a Bank of America financial center, or if you call the bank. You may receive different Bank of America promotional checking offers by various methods, i.e., mail, in person or email/online. These promotional offers may have different terms based on how Bank of America introduces them. To ensure you respond to the correct offer, please reference the original offer received.


This offer is limited to individuals who have not owned or co-owned a Bank of America personal checking account within the last twelve (12) months. Fiduciary accounts (e.g., trusts), Bank of America Advantage SafeBalance Banking® for Family Banking accounts, and business accounts are not eligible for this offer. Offer cannot be combined with any other checking offer and is limited to one bonus per account and per customer. Offer expires on January 31, 2025. Bank of America may change or discontinue this offer at any time before this date without notice.


(1) Open a new eligible personal checking account 
online
 through this offer’s webpage by 
January 31, 2025
, to be enrolled in this offer.


Bank of America Advantage SafeBalance Banking®, Bank of America Advantage Plus Banking®, Bank of America Advantage Relationship Banking® accounts are 
eligible
 for this offer. Bank of America Advantage SafeBalance Banking® for Family Banking accounts are 
not eligible
 for this offer.


(2) Set up and receive Qualifying Direct Deposits totaling $2,000 or more into that eligible Bank of America Advantage Banking account within ninety (90) days of account opening.


A “
Qualifying Direct Deposit
” is a direct deposit of regular monthly income — such as your salary, pension or Social Security benefits, which are made by your employer or other payer — using account and routing numbers that you provide to them. Examples of 
non-qualifying
 transfers and deposits include the following: teller deposits, wire transfers, debit card transfers, ATM transfers or deposits, Online and Mobile Banking transfers or deposits, or transfers from a bank or brokerage account or Merrill investment account.


After you satisfy all of the requirements, we will attempt to deposit the earned bonus directly into your new eligible Bank of America Advantage Banking account within sixty (60) days. The new eligible Bank of America Advantage Banking account must be open and in good standing up to and including the date any earned bonus is paid.


Your receipt of any bonus is subject to validation that you have provided all the information we require in connection with maintaining the account. This includes information needed to identify each account owner and to report the bonus to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), including a validly completed IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8 (as applicable). 
The value of this bonus may constitute taxable income to you.
 
To the extent required by law, Bank of America may withhold tax or other amounts from the payment.
 Bank of America may issue an IRS Form 1099 (or other appropriate form) to you that reflects the value of such bonus. Please consult your tax advisor, as neither Bank of America, its affiliates, nor their employees provide tax advice.




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


The SafeBalance has a $4.95 monthly fee, this is waived with any of the following:




An owner of this account is under the age of 25


Maintain a minimum daily balance of $500 in your account


Are a member in our Preferred Rewards program




Early Account Termination Fee – None


This account has no early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


There is a $500 bonus
, but that requires a $15,000 deposit for 90 days. I think the offers are comparable when you consider a 5% APY account would earn ~$185 over that period so most people will be better off with this offer as it’s a bit more flexible. The only downside is that this one does require a direct deposit. We will of course add this to our 
best bank account bonuses
.

Direct link to offer




Wells Fargo is offering a $325 bonus when you open a new Everyday Checking account and complete the following requirements:



Receive a total of $1,000 or more in qualifying direct deposits to the new checking account within 90 calendar days from account opening (the qualification period)










The Fine Print


Eligibility Requirements:




This offer is for new checking customers only. All Wells Fargo consumer checking accounts are eligible for this offer with the exception of checking accounts offered by Wells Fargo Private Bank.


You must use your bonus offer code at account opening when you apply for a new eligible Wells Fargo checking account.


You are not eligible for this offer if:



You are a current owner of a Wells Fargo consumer checking account


You have received a bonus for opening a Wells Fargo consumer checking account within the past 12 months


You are a Wells Fargo employee








Bonus Requirements:




Open a new Wells Fargo consumer checking account with a minimum opening deposit of $25 by January 6, 2023. All account applications are subject to approval.


Within 90 calendar days of account opening (the “qualification period”), receive a total of $1,000 or more in qualifying direct deposits to your new checking account.



A qualifying direct deposit
 is an ACH (Automated Clearing House) automatic electronic deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular income into your bank account. Confirm with your employer or the agency or company making these payments that they use the ACH network.


Transfers from one account to another, mobile deposits, or deposits made at a branch, or ATM 
don’t qualify as a direct deposit.


A direct deposit made available early with Early Pay Day 
does not count
 toward the bonus requirements 
until it posts to your account and is no longer pending
 (e.g. the pay date scheduled by your payor).








Bonus Payment:




Once the 90-day qualification period has elapsed, we will determine if you have met the offer requirements, and will deposit any earned bonus into your new checking account within 30 days.


The new checking account must remain open throughout the 90-day qualification period and at the time we attempt to deposit any earned bonus payment. Please note that an account with a zero balance may be closed by us without prior notice, as further described in the Deposit Account Agreement.

Wells Fargo Worldwide Military Banking program

Our Verdict


This isn’t as good as the 
$400 bonus we last saw in 2020
, but it is better than the 
$300 bonuses
 we have recently seen. I don’t think that $400 bonus will come back any time soon, but some might prefer to wait for it. I will add this to our 
best bank account bonuses
.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Smart Advantage Checking Account ($350 Bonus)


This account has no monthly fees to worry about


BMO Harris Premier Account ($350 Bonus)


This account has a $25 monthly fee. This is waived with one of the following:




$10,000 minimum daily balance,


$25,000 in combined balances with Relationship Waiver,


or a BMO Harris Financial Advisors, Inc. investment account




Early Account Termination Fee


There is an early account termination fee of $50 if the account is closed within 90 days.


Our Verdict


If you’re doing the savings bonus ($200 or $300) then you’ll have enough money in combined balances to keep the Premier account fee free as well. The savings account earns 0.05% APY for balances $25,000 or under and 0.1% APY for balances $25,000+. 
The most recent BMO Harris offer was for $200 for opening a checking account
, but 
has been as high as $500 with the same requirements
.


This bonus is up to an extra $150 compared to that $500 bonus, but the requirements are much higher. We obviously don’t have any idea if/when that bigger bonus will return so if you can do the full $650 bonus this might be worth considering. Because of that we will add it to our list of the 
best bank bonuses
.

SoFi is offering bonus of up to $300 for new customers who signup for their SoFi hybrid checking & savings account and receive direct deposit within 30 days:



Get $50 bonus with direct deposit of $1,000 – $1,999


Get $100 bonus with direct deposit of $2,000 – $4,999


Get $300 bonus with direct deposit of $5,000+








They seem to have rebranded from ‘SoFi Money’ to ‘SoFi Checking and Savings’.




 


The Fine Print




Eligible Participants: All new members who open a SoFi Checking and Savings account during the Promotion Period and all existing SoFi Checkings and Savings customers who have not previously set up Direct Deposit transactions (“Direct Deposit”) into their SoFi Checking and Savings account as of the beginning of the Promotion Period are eligible for the Program.


Bonus Terms:In order to qualify for eligibility for a bonus, SoFi must receive at least one Qualifying Direct Deposit (as defined below) from an Eligible Participant before the end of the Promotion Period. Qualifying Direct Deposits are defined as deposits of $1,000.00 or greater from an enrolled member’s employer, payroll, or benefits provider via ACH deposit. Deposits that are not from an employer (such as check deposits; P2P transfers such as from PayPal or Venmo, etc.; merchant transactions such as from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.; and external bank ACH transfers not from employers) and bank ACH transfers not from employers) do not qualify for this Direct Deposit promotion. The amount of the bonus, if any, will be calculated during the Evaluation Period as described and defined below.


Evaluation Period: The bonus amount will vary based on the total amount of Qualifying Direct Deposits received during the Evaluation Period. The Evaluation Period is defined as 25 days from the date your first Qualifying Direct Deposit is received. For example, if you receive $1,000-$1,999 in Qualifying Direct Deposits in the Evaluation Period, you will receive a cash bonus of $50. A member may only qualify for one bonus tier and will not be eligible for future bonus payments if inflows subsequently increase beyond the Evaluation Period.


Total Qualifying Direct Deposit amount in 30-day Evaluation Period Cash bonus


Payment timeline: SoFi will credit members who meet qualification criteria within 14 days of the end of the Evaluation Period.


This offer cannot be combined with the SoFi Checking and Savings Direct Deposit rate discount on a SoFi personal loan. Bonuses are considered miscellaneous income, and may be reportable to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC (or Form 1042-S, if applicable). SoFi reserves the right to exclude any Members from participating in the Program for any reason, including suspected fraud, misuse, or if suspicious activities are observed. SoFi also reserves the right to stop or make changes to the Program at any time.

Monthly Fees












This account doesn’t have any monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


Not sure if there is any early termination fee or not, but there is no monthly fee and it’s worth keeping the account open long term for the 
spending bonuses
.


Update History




Update 4/7/25: Increased slightly to $265 and like $280 on Swagbucks/MyPoints. Still $250 on Rakuten.


Update 3/18/25: Currently the best offers are $250 on Rakuten, $230 on Swagbucks, and around $245 on MyPoints now. That’s on top of the $300 from SoFi.


Update 10/6/24:


Update 8/20/24: The $350 Rakuten deal is expired. Best now is $230-$250 from SB/MP, plus the $300 from SoFi.


Update 8/19/24: Rakuten is now up to $350 which can lead to a total bonus of $650. Wow. 
(ht Peter and Jim)


Update 7/15/24: Rakuten is now up to $250/25,000; matches the best offer we’ve seen. MyPoints is around $250, Swagbucks $230. (ht Shawntheshawn)


Update: Now $200 and $300 for a total of $500.


Update 5/6/24: Rakuten is up to $250 and SoFi is at $300. I believe this $550 is the highest ever (and some people might even value Rakuten at even higher than $250).


Update 3/17/24: Both 
Rakuten
 and 
Swagbucks
 at $200 now; plus $300 from SoFi (ht Churnbaby)


Update 3/1/24: Currently $200 from Swagbucks and $300 from SoFi.


Update 11/26/23: Both 
Rakuten
 and 
Swagbucks
 at $200 now; plus $250 from SoFi (ht PN)


Update 11/25/23: Back to $200 on Swagbucks or $175 on Rakuten.


Update 10/18/23: Increased on 
Rakuten
 to $200/20,000


Update 10/13/23: This is still on Swagbucks for 20,000 ($200). It’s now also on 
Rakuten
 for $175/17,500 which some people might prefer. And you can still get $250 on top of that from SoFi directly when you use either link. (ht ShawntheShawn)


Update 6/26/23: 
Swagbucks
 is now up to $200 with $200 direct deposit. Plus you’ll get $250 from SoFi if you receive  $5,000 in direct deposits. Not as good as the all time highs of $520 total but now it’s close. (ht @addingpennies)


Update 4/28/23: 
Swagbucks
/
MyPoints
 are now at an extra $150 for $400 total. Not as good as the all time highs of $520 total but still a nice deal. Update 11/17/22: The Swagbucks/MP part is gone right now. The SoFi part is still at $250. 
Update 10/30/22: Swagbucks still at $220, but SoFi bonus part is down to $250 now (down from $300). Total bonus now of $470; 
Update 10/21/22: Swagbucks is now $220 on the home page + $300 SoFi bonus; 
Update 9/30/22: The $175 Swagbucks offer is back (
direct link
) and – like before – it links to the $300 direct deposit bonus page. Total $475 bonus possible. The $300 deal is valid from 10/1/22 through 12/31/22. 
Update 8/21/22:
 The $300 got extended until September 30th, the additional $175 Swagbucks bonus has still not returned. There’s a new referral offer which gives $325: $25 right away when signing up and depositing $10, plus $300 bonus with direct deposit mentioned below. That’s $25 better than the public link below. I don’t think we’ll make a referral thread for this now, you can google around to find a referral link. It might be smarter to wait to see if another Swagbucks deals comes back. 
Update 6/20/22
: Swagbucks/MP component is gone for now. The $300 offer is still around.
Update 6/14/22:
 Swagbucks is down to $75 now and MyPoints is gone. The $300 SoFi offer is still live. 
Update 5/27/22:
 The $300 SoFi bonus has been extended through July. We don’t know how long the Swagbucks/MyPoints component will last. (
Another update 6/13/22:
 Reader thedailychurn 
suggests
 that if you click through Swagbucks before upgrading your SoFi Money account to become a SoFi Checking & Savings account the Swagbucks/MP can track the upgrade as a new account opening for the $175 bonus. You probably won’t get the $300 signup bonus, though, since it’s not a new account.) 
Update 5/2/22:
 They brought back the Swagbucks/MyPoints $175 bonus, so it’s back up to $475 now. Yay!; Update 4/24/22: The Swagbucks part of the deal has expired. The $300 SoFi bonus is still available.; 
Update
: This $300 bonus seems to stack fine with 
the $175 Swagbucks deal we posted a few months back
 for a total $475. Simply click through Swagbucks (
link
 | 
another link
 | 
MyPoints
) and you’ll see the $300 offer on the landing page, so it should stack. I wonder if they’ll pull the Swagbucks offer as this $300 offer rolls out, so I’d sign up soon.




Our Verdict


I believe $300 is the most we’ve seen from SoFi Money bonuses, though this does require a $5,000 direct deposit. Some readers mention in the comments that SoFi is strict about what they consider to be a ‘direct deposit.’


It’s not clear how quickly you need to get the direct deposit, but it is clear that you have 30 days from when your first direct deposit posts to rack up the $5,000 in direct deposits. E.g. if you sign up on April 5th, get your first direct deposit on May 1, then you have from May 1st through May 30th to meet the $5,000 in combined total direct deposits to qualify for the full $300 bonus.


The fine print states that the income might be reported on a 1099-MISC form which 
might
 mean that it won’t get reported at all given the $600 minimum required for that form. Regardless, you’d be legally required to report the bonus.


Separately, the SoFi Money account is actually a nice account to have your regular direct deposit go to since they offer a nice, high APY rate for those who have a monthly direct deposit (any amount) post to their account. 
At time of this writing that rate is 1.25% APY with no deposit limit.


There’s one 
rumor
 in the comments that upgrading your existing SoFi Money account to the new SoFi checking and savings account will be eligible for the $300 bonus as well (
though you’ll lose the free ATMs when upgrading
), but I’m not assuming this is true unless it gets confirmed.

Changing the terms of this offer could result in a change to any of the offer requirements such as, but not limited to, the required deposit amounts, qualified external deposit sources, the bonus amounts or expiration date. Please note that once your account is opened with a promotional code, the terms of the offer will not change without us notifying you in advance. Offers may vary.

There is no early account termination fee


Our Verdict


There was a 
$250 bonus
, I said to wait for a bigger bonus as we saw 
$350 bonus
 last year. I think this $300 bonus is worth doing though and we will add it to our 
best bank account bonuses
.

 Our Verdict


The Offer


Direct link to offer




PNC is offering checking bonuses of up to $400. Both bonuses require the following direct deposits within 60 days of account opening:



Open a Virtual Wallet Performance Spend and 
receive $200
 with direct deposits totaling $2,000


Open a Virtual Wallet Performance Select and 
receive $400
 with direct deposits totaling $5,000






To qualify for the reward, the new Virtual Wallet product must be opened online via the application links on this page and completed with a mobile device between 5/03/2022 to 6/30/2022






The Fine Print




Offer is contingent on product availability and may vary based on where you open your account and the Zip code of your primary address. For online or phone origination, the Zip code of your primary address will be used to determine product availability. For origination through a PNC location, product availability will be based on the physical PNC location. You may earn a $400 reward if you open a new Virtual Wallet with Performance Select or a $250 reward if you open a new Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend. Changing your product type any time after account opening and prior to the payout of your earned reward, could result in different offer requirements and reward amount.


To qualify for the reward, the new Virtual Wallet product must be opened online via the application links on this page between 9/21/2021 to 10/31/2021, and a qualifying Direct Deposit(s) must be received within the first 60 days. Your Virtual Wallet product must remain open in order for you to receive the reward, which will be credited to the eligible account within 60–90 days after all conditions have been met and will be identified as “Cash Trans Promo Reward” on your monthly statement.


A qualifying Direct Deposit for this offer, is defined as a recurring Direct Deposit of a paycheck, pension, Social Security or other regular monthly income electronically deposited by an employer or an outside agency into the Spend account of a Virtual Wallet with Performance Select or Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend. The total amount of all qualifying Direct Deposits credited to your Spend account must be at least $5,000 for Virtual Wallet Performance Select or $2,000 for Virtual Wallet Performance Spend. Credit card cash advance transfers, wire transfers, person to person transfers, transfers from one account to another or deposits made at a physical PNC location or ATM do not qualify as qualifying Direct Deposits.


New account will not be eligible for offer if any signer has signing authority on an existing PNC Bank consumer checking account or has closed an account within the past 90 days, or has been paid a promotional premium in the past 24 months. If multiple accounts are opened with the same signers, only one account will be eligible for the premium. Trust, Estate and other specialty titled accounts are excluded from this offer. For this offer, signing authority will be defined by the customer name(s) and Social Security number(s) registered on the account. Offer may be extended, modified or discontinued at any time and may vary by market. The value of the reward may be reported on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099, and may be considered taxable income to you. Please consult your tax adviser regarding your specific situation.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Virtual Wallet Checking Pro with Spend ($200 Bonus)


$15 avoidable by 2K DD or 2K average monthly balance


Virtual Wallet With Performance Select $25 Monthly Fee ($400 Bonus)


You can get this fee waived if you meet 
any
 of the following:




Average monthly balance of $5,000 or more


Qualifying direct deposits of $5,000 or more


$25,000 in linked eligible account




Early Account Termination Fee


No longer any EATF
.




Our Verdict


Seems similar to the previous PNC deal
, but this time the $400 link should be showing for more people. Not sure if this deal is available nationwide or not, but the $400 bonus is as good as it gets from PNC so we will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Citi is offering a $325 checking bonus when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Open a new eligible Citi® Checking account with Enhanced Direct Deposits, and enroll in this offer by applying directly from this page.


Deposit at least two (2) Enhanced Direct Deposits directly into your new checking account within 90 calendar days from account opening. Your total combined Enhanced Direct Deposits must equal $3,000 or more.


Your cash bonus will be deposited into your open, eligible Checking Account within 30 days after you successfully complete all required activities.








 


The Fine Print




An EDD is an electronic deposit through the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network of payroll, pension, social security, government benefits and other payments to your checking or savings account. An Enhanced Direct Deposit also includes all deposits via Zelle® and other P2P payments when made via ACH using providers such as Venmo or PayPal. Teller deposits, cash deposits, check deposits, wire transfers, transfers between Citibank accounts, ATM transfers and deposits, mobile check deposits, and P2P payments using a debit card do not qualify as an Enhanced Direct Deposit. (Note: 
see this comment about Zelle.
)


So long as you 
have not owned a Citi checking account in the last 365 days
, meet Tax Requirements, and are at least 18 years old, you can apply to participate in the Enhanced Direct Deposit Checking Acquisition Offer (“Enhanced Direct Deposit Offer”) (click the 
Offer, Product & Pricing Information
 link at the top of the fine print to see this)


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Regular & Access Checking fee waived:




in the month of account opening and for 3 months after account opening or


each month the account has $250+ in Enhanced Direct Deposits




Early Account Termination Fee


In the past, Citi has not charged any ETF, and none is mentioned for this offer.


Our Verdict


This is better than the $200 checking bonus we previously saw
. There is also a 
checking bonus for up to $2,500 but that requires huge deposits
. This smaller bonus will be a better option for most people as those huge deposits aren’t required. I do think now that this is $300 it’s worth doing and we will add it to 
our best bank bonus page
. You can see the definition of an enhanced direct deposit 
here

The Police Credit Union is offering a $300 bonus when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Make ongoing direct deposits totaling $1000 or more within 90 days of Checking Account opening










The Fine Print




To qualify for the $300 bonus, the new member must open a new TPCU Checking account within 90 calendar days of their initial join date, a minimum recurring qualifying direct deposit of $1,000 monthly, must be deposited within 90 days of checking account opening (two direct deposits of $500 are acceptable).


Qualifying direct deposits are deposits of regular monthly income (such as your salary, pension, or Social Security benefits) that are made by your employer or other payer using the account and routing numbers that you provide to them.


The bonus will be deposited into the new checking account within 60 business days after meeting the $1,000 direct deposit requirement.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them

Monthly Fees












This account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so unsure if there is any EATF.


Our Verdict


Seems difficult to get approved if you have many inquiries in the last 90 days. Overall the bonus is good and worth doing if you can get approved. Suspect it might die early so hop on it if you’re interested. Will add to our 
best bank account bonuses
.

Credit Karma has been offering a $500 bonus when you open a line of credit
. It’s not 100% clear if you can do this $100 referral bonus and then that $500 bonus (
some discussion of it here
). If you can only do one then that $500 bonus will be a much better offer.

Direct link to offer




Affinity Federal Credit Union is offering a $100 referral bonus to both parties when the new member opens an affinity cash back debit account with a direct deposit of $100+ within 60 days of account opening






The Fine Print




*The Member, or Referrer. Members of Affinity Federal Credit Union in good standing and 18 years of age or older with an active Affinity checking or savings account are eligible to participate. Once a member makes a referral, they become a “Referrer” and will be provided with a unique referral link that allows them to receive a $100 bonus for each referred friend or family that has met all the qualifying criteria as defined below. The member may earn a maximum of $1,000 in referral bonuses per calendar year, which equates to 10 friends, family or colleagues completing the qualifying criteria. There is no limit to the number of referrals a member can make.


The Friend, Family or Referred. In order to receive the $100 bonus, the referred friend or member must 1) Open an Affinity Cash Back Debit account 2) Make a qualifying direct deposit of $100 or more within 60 days of account opening. A qualifying direct deposit is an automatic electronic deposit known as an ACH (Automated Clearing House) of your paycheck, Social Security, pension, or other recurring income in the amount of $100 or more. Multiple deposits totaling $100 do not qualify. External and internal transfers, mobile deposits, cash, or check deposits and person-to-person payments such as Zelle®, do not qualify as a direct deposit. Offer valid only for new members who join Affinity.


Fulfillment. Bonus will be deposited into the referring member and new member’s checking account by the last business day of the month following completion of all qualifying criteria (for example: if the new member’s account is opened on July 15, 2022; qualifying deposits are made by August 13; $100 bonus will be deposited to the members eligible checking or savings account and the new member’s Cash Back debit account by September 30, 2022). Bonus may be reported as taxable income and will be reported on an IRS 1099 Form, if applicable. Additional exclusions may apply. Offer subject to change without notice.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees












This account has no monthly fees to worry about


Early Account Termination Fee


This account has no EATF.


Our Verdict


Sometimes this account is only open to NY, CT. Doesn’t look to be the case at the moment. Has been as high as $150 in the past, this is a better offer if a friend or family member can refer you. Do not share your referrals in the comments, you can share them in 
this linked post instead

Hat tip to reader Parts Unknown


Update 3/31/21: Requirements for the $100 bonus are now the same as they were for the $200 bonus and the $200 bonus has been removed entirely. Disappointing to see as it makes the offer far worse.

 Our Verdict


The Offer


Direct link to offer 
(READ CAREFULLY: this just shows you the offer details. You can’t sign up using this link otherwise you won’t get the bonus. You need to use a referral link)




Charles Schwab is offering a referral bonus of up to $500 when you’re referred by a friend with a Charles Schwab account and open a new eligible account. The bonus you receive depends on your net deposit (this must be maintained for one year, minus any market losses):



Deposit $25,000-$49,999 and get a $100 bonus


Deposit $50,000-$99,999 and get a $300 bonus


Deposit $100,000-$499,999 and get a $500 bonus


Deposit $500,000 and get a $1,000 bonus










The Fine Print




Offer valid for referred individuals who do not currently have a Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (“Schwab”) account (other than a Stock Plan Services account) and who open and make a qualifying net deposit into an eligible retail brokerage account within 45 days of enrolling in the offer.


Net deposits are assets deposited into the enrolled account minus assets withdrawn from the account and transferred out of Schwab.


Only outside assets new to Schwab qualify; assets transferred from affiliates other than Schwab Retirement Plan Services are excluded.


Net deposits will be calculated as of the 45th day after enrollment, and the bonus award will be credited to the enrolled account within approximately one week.


For taxable accounts, you must maintain the net deposit amount (less any market losses) at Schwab for at least one year or Schwab may charge back the bonus award.


Schwab reserves the right to change the offer terms or terminate the offer at any time without notice.


This offer is limited to one per account, with no more than one account enrolled per client.


It does not apply to accounts managed by independent investment advisors, the Schwab Global Account™, ERISA-covered retirement plans, certain tax-qualified retirement plans and accounts, or education savings accounts.


The bonus award, when combined with the value received from all other offers in the last 12 months, may not exceed $5,000 per household, as defined in the Charles Schwab Pricing Guide for Individual Investors.


This offer is not transferable, saleable, or valid in conjunction with other offers and is available to U.S. residents only.


Employees, contractors, or persons similarly associated with Schwab or a Schwab affiliate; their spouses; and employees of any securities regulatory organization or exchange are not eligible. Other restrictions may apply.


Consult with your tax advisor about the appropriate tax treatment for this offer and any tax implications associated with receipt before enrolling. Any related taxes are your responsibility. For taxable accounts, the bonus award will be reported on your Form 1099-INT. IRS guidance may impact your ability to make more than one IRA-to-IRA rollover in a one-year period.




Our Verdict












Previously the bonus was $100
, but didn’t have a deposit requirement. Looks like both the checking account and brokerage account are eligible for this offer, opening either account is a hard pull on your credit report but both of the accounts are useful for different reasons (and you can open both and only one hard pull will be done).




Opening the brokerage account makes you eligible for the 
Charles Schwab American Express cards
.


The checking account refunds all ATM fees (including international withdrawals) and does not charge any forex fees making it a 
great option for overseas travel
.




Keep in mind you actually need to be referred for this offer, previously it wasn’t required but they are verifying you are verified these days so keep that in mind. The person who refers you doesn’t get anything, so it can be difficult to find somebody to refer you. I’ll add this to 
our list of the best brokerage bonuses
 due to the new tiered payout structure.


Do not request a referral in the comments below. You can request a referral 
in this dedicated thread.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


The free checking account has no monthly fees to worry about


$1 Paper Statements


After your second month you’ll be charged $1 for paper statements, so opt in for paperless statements when signing up.


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so I’m unsure if there is any early account termination fee or not.


Our Verdict


Previous deal was for $100, but you also got two LA Rams tickets that could easily be resold for more than $50
. That deal also didn’t require any debit card transactions. This bonus isn’t that bad, but the debit card transactions will be difficult for most people to meet – especially as it requires the transaction to be more than $5. Really up to you if you want to go for this deal or wait for a better deal to return. I’ll likely add this to 
our list of best bank bonuses
, just with a disclaimer that they have recently offered a bigger bonus.

$300 bonus—The new money deposited from an external bank during the Initial Funding Period was between $20,000-$49,999.99, and you maintained that Deposit Amount for 90 days following the Initial Funding Period.


$750 bonus—The new money deposited from an external bank during the Initial Funding Period was between $50,000-$99,999.99, and you maintained that Deposit Amount for 90 days following the Initial Funding Period.


$1,500 bonus—The new money deposited from an external bank during the Initial Funding Period was $100,000 or more, and you maintained that Deposit Amount for 90 days following the Initial Funding Period.






Capital One will deposit the bonus into your account within 60 days after you have completed all the requirements above, including fulfilling the 90-day holding period. If your account is in default, closed or suspended, or otherwise not in good standing, you will not receive the bonus. If at any time during the 90 days following the Initial Funding Period your Deposit Amount drops into a lower tier, you will be rewarded that tier’s cash bonus. If your Deposit Amount decreases to an amount less than $20,000, you will not qualify for a cash bonus. This offer cannot be combined with any other 360 Performance Savings account opening offers. Only one promotional code is accepted per account. Bonus is only valid for one new 360 Performance Savings account. Bonuses are considered interest and will be reported on IRS form 1099-INT.


If you have or had an open 360 Performance Savings, 360 Savings, 360 Money Market, Savings Now or Confidence Savings account as a primary or secondary account holder with Capital One on or after January 1, 
 2022, you will be ineligible for the bonus.
 If your account is in default, closed or suspended, or otherwise not in good standing, you will not receive the bonus.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fees to worry about


Early Account Termination Fee


There is no early account termination fee


Our Verdict


This account earns 4.3% APY, ends up being 10.4% APY over the bonus period once when you take into account the bonus but obviously only lasts for 90 days. Still worth doing for a lot of people and much better than the 
previous $1,000 bonus
 and better than other 
high interest savings rates
. We will add this to 
our list of the best savings bonuses
.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Citi is offering a sign up bonus of up to $2,000 when you open a new checking account in the Citi Account Package. The bonus you receive depends the amount you fund within 20 days of account opening and maintain that deposit for 60 days from the 21st day.





Earn $500 with a minimum deposit of $30,000+




Earn $1,500 with a minimum deposit of $200,000+










 


The Fine Print




All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Citi Basic Account Package has a $12 monthly fee, this is waived if you do any of the following:




Make one qualifying direct deposit per statement period and one qualifying bill payment per statement period or


Maintain a $1,500+ combined average monthly balance in eligible linked accounts






Early Account Termination Fee


In the past, Citi has not charged any ETF, and none is mentioned for this offer.


Our Verdict


Ideally you’d deposit your funds in the account as close to the 20 day period as possible and then withdraw shortly after the 60th day. Realistically you’ll probably need the funds in there for a minimum of 65-70 days if not longer. 
Rates for citi vary from 0.05% – 0.15% APY depending on the account package opened
.


You really need to think of this as a 
savings bonus
 and 
compared it to high yield savings rates
. For example if you put $300,000 into a 1% account you’d earn $530+ in a 65 day period. But if it was in a 4% account you’d earn $2,120 (more than the bonus on offer). The bonus actually scales and gets worse as it gets bigger. Reader Mark E put together this APY table based on a 70 day hold period:




 not currently available


$30,000/$500 Tier = ~8.65% APY


$75,000/$1,000 Tier = ~6.93% APY


$200,000/$1,500 Tier = ~3.9% APY


$300,000/$2,000 Tier = ~3.46% APY

The Offer












Direct Link to offer for new savings customers 
|




Wells Fargo is offering a $525 bonus when you open a new savings account and deposit $25,000 within 30 days. Must maintain the balance through Day 90 from account opening.






The Fine Print




This offer is for new savings customers only. All Wells Fargo consumer savings accounts are eligible for this offer with the exception of Time Accounts (CDs) and savings accounts offered by Wells Fargo Private Bank.


You must use your bonus offer code at account opening when you apply for a new eligible Wells Fargo savings account.


You are not eligible for this offer if:



You are a current owner of a Wells Fargo consumer savings account


You have received any other consumer savings offer bonus or promotional rate that required a bonus offer code within the past 12 months.


You are a Wells Fargo employee






To receive the bonus, you must: 1) Open a new Wells Fargo consumer savings account with a minimum opening deposit of $25 in a Wells Fargo branch by June 27, 2023. All account applications are subject to approval. 2) Bring $25,000 or more in new money to your new savings account by Day 30 and maintain at least a $25,000 balance through Day 90 after account opening. New money is money that is 
new to the customer or new to Wells Fargo
 (deposited into the customer’s new savings account directly from outside of Wells Fargo and Company and all affiliates, or from a Wells Fargo account not owned by the customer).


We will deposit your bonus into your new savings account within 30 days after you have met all offer requirements.


The new savings account must be open at the time we attempt to deposit any earned bonus payment. Please note that an account with a zero balance may be closed by us without prior notice, as further described in the Deposit Account Agreement.


You are responsible for any federal, state, or local taxes due on the bonus and we will report as income to the tax authorities if required by applicable law. Consult your tax advisor.




Avoiding Fees


The Wells Fargo Way2Save Savings account monthly service fee is $5. Minimum opening deposit is $25. The monthly service fee can be avoided with one of the following each fee period:




$300 minimum daily balance


Automatic transfer each fee period of $25 or more from a linked Wells Fargo checking account


Automatic transfer each business day within the fee period of $1 or more from a linked Wells Fargo checking account


or more Save As You Go® transfers from a linked Wells Fargo checking account. A qualifying Save As You Go transfer is an automatic transfer of $1 from your linked Wells Fargo checking account to your Way2Save Savings account each time you (or any authorized signer or joint owner) use your debit card for a one-time purchase or complete a Bill Pay transaction through online banking, and the one-time debit card purchase or Bill Pay transaction posts to the account. We reserve the right to determine through our sole discretion if a particular transaction is a qualifying transaction.


Primary account owner is 24 years old or under. (When the primary account owner reaches the age of 25, age can no longer be used to avoid the monthly service fee.) Customers 12 and under must have an adult co-owner.




Initial monthly service fee waiver (
pdf
): “We’ll waive the monthly service fee for each fee period ending within the first 64 days of opening.”


Our Verdict


You’ll lose out on $200-$300 in interest by using this savings account which doesn’t earn much interest versus 
a high yield savings account
. Still might be worth it for the $525 bonus + .15% interest that the account earns. 
Update
: 
readers note
 that you can have the banker enroll you
 in this Platinum savings account
 which has a decent interest rate.


I see this as more interesting in conjunction with 
the Wells Fargo Premier checking $2,500 bonus offer which requires $250,000 in assets transferred
. Far as I can tell from the fine prints, the two offers should work in tandem, and the $25,000 savings account will count toward your $250,000 threshold needed for the checking/investing bonus. Seems like a nice way of sweetening the pot a bit on that $2,500 Premier checking bonus, and it should be possible to bring in both promo codes to the branch and open both accounts at the same time. 
Update 3/24/23
: 
multiple 
readers
 heard from their banker that the $25k won’t stack with the $250k offer. 
Update 11/24/24:
 In reality it 
probably will stack
.


We’ll add this to our list of 
Best Bank Signup Bonuses.

The Offer


Direct Link to offer




CIT Bank is offering a bonus to new or existing customers who transfer over funds. To get the bonus, you have to first signup/enroll using promo code 
PS2025
 and then make one or more deposits in the following 30 days.



Transfer over $25,000 in new deposits and get $225.


Transfer over $50,000 in new deposits and get $300.










The Fine Print




All funds deposited to qualify for the bonus must be new funds from a source outside CIT Bank. Funds already on deposit with CIT Bank are ineligible.


CIT Bank will deposit the qualifying bonus into the customer’s enrolled account within 60-days following the 30-day funding period. The enrolled Platinum Savings account must be open at the time of the bonus payment to qualify.


There is a limit of one Platinum Savings promotional offer per account and per Primary customer. If multiple Platinum Savings accounts are opened, only one account per primary account owner is eligible. Custodial accounts and Trust Accounts are not eligible.


The value of the $225 or $300 bonus will be reported as interest income on IRS Form 1099-INT for the calendar year in which it was paid. The recipient is responsible for any applicable taxes.




Avoiding Fees












Account has no fees to worry about.


Our Verdict


This is a nice bonus since the account earns 4.30% which
 is from the better rates out there
, and with this promo you’ll earn an additional $225/$300. I like the flexibility of this offer without any hold period (just have the funds there on Day 30), and I might get in on this one.


We’ll add this to 
our List Of Best Bank Bonuses.

Starting at 12:00AM EST on January 30, 2024, through 11:59PM EST on April 30, 2024 (“Campaign Period”), a $50 bonus (the “Bonus”) will be awarded to Laurel Road members (“Referrer”) for each friend who opens a new Laurel Road High Yield Savings (HYS) account (the “Referred”) and meets the following requirements, the Referred must 1) submit the HYS account application through the Referrer’s link during the Campaign Period. 2) have a minimum HYS account balance of at least $1 by 7PM EST within the first twenty (20) calendar days of account opening, and 3) have a minimum balance of $5,000 by 11:59PM EST on the ninetieth (90th) calendar day of account opening for Referrer to earn the Bonus.

All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


None


Our Verdict


Bonus is interesting for two reasons:




Account earns 5% APY and this is competitive with other 
high yield rates


You only need a balance on day 90




You’ll likely need to tie up funds for a week or so but still worth doing if you have a lot of liquid funds available. Person referring also gets a $50 bonus. We will add this to 
our list of the best checking bonuses

All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fees to worry about


Early Account Termination Fee












Unsure if there is any EATF.


Our Verdict


Saving account earns 3.15% when you have a $35,000 balance. Best case scenario you need to hold the funds for 4 months (slightly longer after adding and withdrawing). This works out to be an additional 2.85% when annualized for a total return of 6%. This is slightly better than 
current high yield rates but whether
 it’s worth it is up to you. The direct deposit portion is annoying as it requires it for five months.

Apply for your 
first
 
Discover Online Savings Account
, AND


Enter offer code GOBP623 when applying, AND


Deposit a total of at least $15,000 into your account within 30 days to earn a $150 Bonus, OR


Deposit a total of at least $25,000 into your account  within 30 days to earn a $200 Bonus.


Deposit at least $45,000 within 45 days of account open date to earn a $400 bonus


According to this datapoint cumulative deposits will work
, YMMV as always. Lots of DP suggesting this works now.




 




The Fine Print




Offer not valid for existing or prior Discover savings customers or existing or prior customers with savings accounts that are co-branded or affinity accounts provided by Discover (this bit is new)


Account must be open when bonus is credited.


Bonus will be credited to the account by 11/4/19.


Bonus is considered interest and will be reported on IRS Form 1099-INT.


Offer may be modified/withdrawn.




Avoiding Fees


Discover’s Online Savings Account does not have any fees, nor any minimum balance requirement. You can withdraw any funds you wish after fulfilling the $25,000 (or $15,000) deposit requirement.


Early Termination Fee


There is no mention of an early termination fee according to the 
Online Savings Account Guide
. You must, at minimum, leave the account open until the bonus posts, or November 30, 2017.


Our Verdict


The deposit requirement increasing to $25,000 shouldn’t matter too much as it looks like cumulative deposits work anyway. The best part of this deal is that there is no deposit minimum length so you should be able to deposit the (or $15,000) and then immediately withdraw it. In the past the bonus has posted 5–15 days after the deposited has been received but recently it has been taking much longer. A lot of people like these Discover bonuses because they also offer a decent APY (0.40% currently), although 
there are better APYs available
. This is one of the 
best savings account bonuses
 currently available.

Update 09/10/2018: There is a new working link. This one is definitely not an affiliate link of any type.


Update 07/20: There is a 
new working link
 that doesn’t look like it’s a NerdWallet link, but might be an affiliate link for another site.


Update 07/12/18: There is a new working link that is valid until 7/31/2018. This is another NerdWallet link and they will get comission if you use it. I personally don’t like NerdWallet as they are affiliate link focused and don’t always post the best deals. That being said I want my readers to have the best choice possible so that’s why I’m adding it. If anybody finds a non NerdWallet link let us know. You might also just be able to use promo code SAVE718E1 or SAVE718E2 and it should work. We don’t receive anything if you use the NerdWallet link or any other bank account bonus or credit card link as we believe remaining independent is important.


Update 06/05/18: Bonus has been extended until 6/29/18


Update 05/18/18: Gadget & rediff found a new working code: SAVE518E1. This means NerdWallet won’t get paid when you use this code. 
This link should also work
, but not sure if it’s one time use or not.


Update 05/09/18: Deal is back and valid until 6/4/18. New promo code is NW518. Sadly I think this is an exclusive offer to NerdWallet and they get paid if you use this link. Personally I hate NerdWallet because I find they suggest inferior offers on a regular basis but this Discover Savings bonus is a great deal. I’ve tried to get Discover to agree to give money to charity instead of paying out affiliate commissions but they never respond.


Update 03/27/18 : Deal has been extended until 05/04/2018. New promo code is SAVE318D2. Hat tip to reader

Multiple people are reporting of the following offer from Citizens Bank:




Citizens Bank is offering a $500 bonus when you open a new savings account and deposit $10,000 for 5 months or $250 if you deposit $5,000 for 5 months.






 


The Fine Print






1
 
To Earn Bonus
: You must, 1) have an existing personal checking account or open your first new personal checking account between 4/17/24 and 4/30/24 and, 2) have an existing personal savings account or open your first new personal savings account between 4/17/24 and 4/30/24 and have the required minimum total deposit (with money not currently on deposit with Citizens) post to one savings account between 4/17/24 and 4/30/24.






For account holders with more than one savings account, the minimum total deposit amount must be made into a single savings account and funds must then remain on deposit until September 30, 2024. Deposits between $5,000-$9,999.99 will receive a 
$250
 bonus or deposits of $10,000 or more will receive a 
$500
 bonus.






Qualifications
: Your new or existing accounts must have a balance greater than zero and remain open and active through the payout date stated in the table below to qualify for this offer. Savings account must maintain the required balance until September 30, 2024. Money market accounts, CDs, and Citizens Access accounts are excluded.






Eligibility
: Customer will be paid only one, one-time bonus for this program. Only one savings account is eligible for a bonus. Offers may be withdrawn without notice. Offer eligibility is determined at Citizens’ sole discretion.






Payout
: Bonus will be deposited to the checking account by the date stated in the table below and will be labeled as “Balance Builder Bonus”. If your checking account is closed prior to payout date stated in the table below, then your savings account will also no longer be eligible for this offer. Bonus will be reported to the IRS for income tax purposes.




All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them
















Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fee as long as you have a Quest checking account.


For One Deposit savings account, you can maintain a $200 minimum daily balance to waive the monthly maintenance fee. No monthly maintenance fee while you’re under 25 or over 65. Account will automatically receive a waiver on the first 4 monthly maintenance fees.


Early Account Termination Fee


As far as we know there is no early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


We just saw
 the public $300 offer
 expire. This offer is bonus is better, though remember the downside in the lack of interest earning and the 5 month lockup. Still a 5% earn in just 5 months is a solid return (it equals around 12% APY) and well worth considering.


I have a Citizens Bank checking and tried to open a savings account with the online link, but am having trouble adding the savings account. I’m a bit confused how to enroll in this offer – perhaps any customer who adds $5,000/$10,000 to their savings account will get the bonus, without the need to signup for the offer in any way. Let us know if you get this to work.

Avoiding Fees


There are no monthly fees on this account, it does need to stay open for at least 90 days otherwise you’ll be charged a $30 early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


This bonus is now significantly better than it once was due to the requirements being lowered (before you need to have made a lot of debit card purchases to get the full bonus and spend a total of $1,200). The money market bonus is also worth doing. We will add this to 
our best bank bonus page
.

The Offer


Direct Link to offer
 (open incognito if link doesn’t work)




Chase is offering a $500 bonus when you open a Chase Business checking account and complete the following qualifications:



Fund a minimum deposit of $10,000 in new money within 30 days of offer enrollment and maintain that balance for 60 days.


Complete 5 qualifying transactions within 90 days of offer enrollment. 
Qualifying transactions include debit card purchases, Chase QuickAccept deposits, Chase QuickDeposit, ACH (Credits), wires (credits and debits), Chase Online Bill Pay




















 


The Fine Print




Your bonus will be deposited within 15 business days


Account must stay open for six months, otherwise bonus is forfeited


You can receive only one new business checking account opening related bonus every two years from the last enrollment date and only one bonus per account


Checking offer is not available to existing Chase business checking customers, local, state or Federal Government entities or agencies, Not for Profit organizations, Political Action Committees, or those with campaign accounts, or whose accounts have been closed within 90 days or closed with a negative balance within the last 3 years


All bank account bonuses are treated as interest, as such you must pay taxes on them.




Avoiding Fees


This offer is for the Business Complete Checking account. Monthly fee is $15 which can be waived with 
one of the following:




Maintain a $2,000 deposit minimum daily balance


Spend at least $2,000 on purchases with a Chase Ink business credit card


Receive $2,000 in deposits from QuickAccept transactions or other eligible payment solutions


Link a Chase Private Client checking account


Provide valid, qualifying proof of military status (active or veteran)




Early Account Termination Fee


None mentioned.


Our Verdict


There have been occasional $750 Chase business checking bonuses, but those are typically only for Private Clients or as 
a targeted deal
. This offer is publicly available and works for accounts opened online. It’s easy enough to keep the account fee-free with the $2,000 deposit requirement or the $2,000 INK spend requirement.


We’ve added this bonus to 
our list of the best business bank bonuses.


Note
: the bank has been withholding $120 of this bonus toward your estimated taxes, 
see this post for more details.

$400




Wells Fargo is offering two business checking bonuses. Both bonuses require opening a Initiate Business Checking account.



$400 bonus when you deposit $2,500 or more to your new business checking account by day 30 and maintain a minimum daily collected balance of $2,500 through day 60 after account opening


$825 bonus when you deposit $25,000 or more to your new business checking account by day 30 and maintain a minimum daily collected balance of $25,000 through day 60 after account opening










The Fine Print




All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees












The Initiate Business Checking account has $10 monthly fee which is waived if you have one of the following each fee period:




$500 minimum daily balance, OR


$1,000 average ledger balance




Early Account Termination Fee


There is no early account termination fee mentioned.


Our Verdict


Not as good as the previous 
$1,500 in branch offer
, but that was back in 2022 so I’m not sure we will see that again. With this new bonus you’re basically needing to hold the funds in there for 30 days (realistically a little longer to deal with transfers). Both bonuses are worth doing given the returns, the one you prefer will depend on how much cash you have on hand. Will add this to our 
best business checking bonus page
.

more on this in this post)

Enjoy fee-free ATM withdrawals at 37,000 MoneyPass® ATM locations nationwide.


Mobile deposits

The Fine Print




To be eligible to earn a Welcome Offer of 20,000 Membership Rewards
®
 points (the “Welcome Offer”), you must meet each of the following qualifying criteria:



Open your first American Express
®
 Business Checking account, which is subject to approval;


Deposit a total of $5,000 or more in “new money” into your account within twenty (20) days of account opening (the new money must also post to your account and appear in your Available Balance within twenty (20) days of account opening). “New money” is defined as deposits that are not deposited from any other American Express
®
 Business Checking account and are not deposited using our Redeem Membership Rewards points for Deposits feature;


Maintain an average balance in your account of at least $5,000 for sixty (60) days, starting on the date that your deposits of new money are equal to $5,000 or greater; and


Complete 10 qualifying transactions within sixty (60) days of account opening. “Qualifying transactions” are defined as mobile deposits, and electronic/online transactions, including ACH, Wire, and Bill Payments made to or from your account. Business Debit Card transactions and deposits using our Redeem Membership Rewards points for Deposits feature are not qualifying transactions. Transfers between American Express
®
 Business Checking accounts held by the same business are not qualifying transactions. Stop payments and transactions that do not post to your account and do not appear in your Available Balance within sixty (60) days of account opening are not qualifying transactions. You are not eligible to earn a Welcome Offer for any accounts opened for a business that currently has or has had an American Express
®
 Business Checking account. 






After you have completed all the above qualifying criteria, American Express will credit the Membership Rewards points to the Membership Rewards Program Account linked to your American Express® Business Checking account within 8-12 weeks. We may not credit the Membership Rewards points, or we may take away the Membership Rewards points if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with the offer in any way or that you intend to do so. We may also cancel this account and other accounts you may have with us if we determine abuse, misuse or gaming behavior has been shown. Your American Express® Business Checking account must be open at the time of fulfillment; we may not credit the Membership Rewards points if you or we close your American Express® Business Checking account.


The Welcome Offer may be taxable income to you and may be reported on IRS Form 1099. You are responsible for any federal or state taxes resulting from the offer. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions about the tax treatment of the Welcome Offer.




Avoiding Fees




This account has no monthly fees to worry about.


There is no early account termination fee mentioned.


Incoming and outgoing ACHs are free, and incoming international ACHs are free. Incoming domestic wires are free. Outgoing domestic wires cost $20 each.


Foreign Transaction Fee (Foreign Purchases & ATM Transactions): 2.7% of the amount of each transaction after conversion to US dollars




Our Verdict


Pretty sweet bonus for opening a business checking account (
we mentioned this rumored account previously
). They had 
a very similar $300 bonus
 which is now expired in favor of the new 20k points bonus. We’ll add this to 
our list of Best Bank Bonuses. 


The fine print states that the welcome bonus may be taxable and may be reported on a 1099, presumably at a value or either .8 or 1 cent per point (see below). Regardless, some people will value the points more than $300.  I assume that someone who did the $300 bonus will not be eligible to do this points bonus. Perhaps if they closed the old account they’d be able to then reopen it under the new offer.


Some readers in the comments report getting approved when applying as a sole proprietorship using their SSN and then uploading their driver’s license as your business documents proof.


A few other features of this account are worth highlighting:




The 1.10% APY. A few months ago that was an excellent rate, and it’s 
still a good rate
, but I’m disappointed that they don’t seem to be raising the rate as interest rates rise. And so I’m not counting on seeing this higher, even if 
regular high yield accounts
 are offering way more in the future.


The new feature here is the ability to earn 1 point per $2 spent on the debit card. (It’s similar to
 the personal American Express checking account which has this feature
.) Those who signed up earlier for this Amex business checking account get the rewards-earning on their debit card as well.



You can check the comments of 
the prior post on the similar personal Amex checking account
 for data points on what will work as a ‘debit card’ purchase to get the rewards. As far as I know, there was nothing interesting that was considered a debit card purchase, and thus the points-earning feature is mostly useless. I can still see a scenario of a real business who uses debit-only, for whatever reason, and finds this worthwhile.






There’s a new points conversion feature with this business checking account which allows converting Membership Rewards points into cash. Importantly, you can cash out all of your pooled points through your Amex business checking, not just the points earned on the business checking. Briefly, you’ll get .8 cents per points cashed out into your business checking account, but if you have the Business Platinum you’ll get 1 cent per point. 
This is a nice new feature which we write about more in a dedicated post.


Also, this new checking account 
should
 now be another way of keeping your Membership Rewards points alive when you close out all of your credit card. So long as the points are pooling together correctly, this fee-free account should keep them alive. Previously, the Blue Business Plus/Cash and the Everyday cards were the only fee-free methods of keeping points alive.

Our Verdict


Reader Jay was able to get this offer just by going into a branch and asking if they had any current promotions for opening a new account. Entirely possible it won’t be available in all/most branches, but feel free to share your data points in the comments below. Similar to a previous targeted bonus, 
with higher tiers available as well
. The return gets worse as the bonus increases as unfortunately.

Platinum account has a $30 monthly fee, this is waived if you



 An active U.S. Bank Payment Solutions Merchant Account or


$25,000 average collected checking balance $75,000 combined average collected business deposits and outstanding business credit balances








Early Account Termination Fee


There is no early account termination fee to worry about


Our Verdict


Previously there was a 
$800 business checking bonus
 with the same requirements as the current $900 bonus but it only required a silver account which is much easier to keep fee free. Because of that I think the old $800 bonus is actually better. That being said the new $400 bonus is the exact same requirements as the old $300 bonus with the same account needing to be opened so that is an improvement and worth doing. Given the churn period is now only 12 months I do think the $400 bonus is worth doing and we will add it to our 
best business bank bonus page
.

BlueVine business checking is offering a $300 signup bonus:


 




To get your $300 bonus, apply for a Bluevine Business Checking account by 7/31/2024 using referral code NW300


After opening your account, add funds within 30 days, then meet at least 
one of the following
 eligibility requirements 
every 30 days
 for the next 90 days from account funding:










Deposit at least $5,000 from eligible merchant services to your Bluevine account


Make at least $5,000 of outbound payroll payments from your Bluevine account

using eligible payroll providers


Spend at least $2,000 with your Bluevine Business Debit Mastercard and/or Bluevine

Business Cashback Mastercard










The Fine Print




Bluevine is a financial technology company, not a bank. Bluevine deposits are FDIC-insured through Coastal Community Bank.


For the avoidance of doubt, a New Customer is a natural person who does not have an existing Bluevine Business Checking Account held in the name of a business of which they are an owner and has not had such an account open in the last twelve (12) months.


In order to be eligible, New Customers must be (i) at least 18 years old; and (ii) a legal resident of the fifty (50) United States or Washington, DC. Officers, directors, managers, and employees of Sponsor and of its parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, as well as the immediate family members (spouse, parents, siblings, and children) and/or household members of each such person are not eligible.


Conditions and Promotional Period: To be eligible to receive the bonus associated with this promotion, New Customers must 1) apply for and open a Bluevine Business Checking Account using a bonus offer code between 12:00:00 AM EST on June 24, 2024 and 11:59:59 PM EST on July 31, 2024.; 2) fund their Bluevine Business Checking Account within thirty (30) days of account opening; and 3) meet at least one of the following conditions every thirty (30) days for ninety (90) days from account funding: a) receive at least $5,000.00 in deposits from eligible Merchant Services; b) make at least $5,000.00 in payments through eligible Payroll Providers; or c) spend at least $2,000.00 with the Bluevine Business Debit Mastercard® and/or Bluevine Business Cashback Mastercard®. A list of eligible Merchant Services and Payroll Providers (each an “Eligible Third Party”) can be found at https://www.bluevine.com/eligible-merchant-services-and-payroll-providers. Bluevine will make its best effort to attribute transactions to the correct Eligible Party. For the avoidance of doubt, Bluevine’s computer is the official time-keeping device for the promotion.


Notification: If a New Customer meets all of the eligibility requirements and conditions of the promotion, Bluevine will deposit the bonus into their Bluevine Business Checking Account by the tenth day of the month that follows the month in which the last requirement was met provided that the account is not closed or suspended.


Limitation of Liability: Bluevine and its respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents, shall have no liability and shall be held harmless by participants for any damage, loss or liability to persons or property, due in whole or part, directly or indirectly, by reason of the acceptance, possession, use or misuse of prize or participation in this promotion. Bluevine reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify or end the promotion at any time and exclude any participant for any reason, including suspected fraud, misuse, or other misconduct and may also terminate any Bluevine accounts you may have with us. Bluevine also reserves the right to reverse the bonus if a New Customer closes their Bluevine Business Checking Account within 150 days of funding it.


Miscellaneous: The bonus associated with this promotion is considered interest and will be reported on IRS Form 1099-INT. You are responsible for any federal or state taxes resulting from the promotion. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions about tax treatment.




Avoiding Fees




Blue vine has no monthly fees, no overdraft fees, no minimum balance, free standard ACH, and unlimited transactions.




There is an EATF if closed within 150 days.


Our Verdict


Good chance for businesses to try out this bank option with this $300 bonus. It’s not an easy bonus due to the spend/payroll/processing requirements which needs to be done three times. Still might interest some readers who have lots of debit card spend. We’ve added this to
 our List of Best Bank Bonuses.


Bluevine also offer 2% APY on balances up to $250,000 which is something most business checking accounts don’t have.

Bank of America is offering a $200 bonus when you open a new business checking account and complete the following requirements:



Make Qualifying Deposits of $5,000 or more in new money* within 30 days of opening the new business checking account


Maintain an average balance of $5,000 for next 60 days (day 31-90) during the maintenance period










The Fine Print




All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Business fundamentals is the easiest account to keep fee free with a $16 monthly fee. This is waived if you do any of the following:




Maintain a $5,000 combined average balance


Spend at least $250 in new net purchases on your business debit card


Become a member of Preferred Rewards for Business




Early Account Termination Fee


There is no early account termination fee


Our Verdict


Bank of America business checking bonuses normally have targeted language, like the 
frequent $500 bonus
. The nice part of this bonus is that it only requires a $5,000 deposit for 90 days vs $20,000 for the $500 bonus. With 
interest rates being so high for savings accounts
 the opportunity cost of $5,000 for 90 days at 5% is ~$61 ($244 for the $500 bonus). We will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

you have completed ten (10) point-of-sale transactions per month using your Small Business Checking Visa® Debit Card for signature-based purchases with a minimum of $3 per transaction,


You must also have bill pay set up and connected to your Basic Business Checking account or Business Interest Checking account.






Alternatively a $300 bonus can be earned. $75 will be earned for each statement cycle, up to $300 when you meet three requirements



the average daily balance in your Basic Business Checking account or Business Interest Checking Account is between $25,000 and $49,999.99,


you have completed ten (10) point-of-sale transactions per month using your Small Business Checking Visa® Debit Card for signature-based purchases with a minimum of $3 per transaction,


You must also have bill pay set up and connected to your Basic Business Checking account or Business Interest Checking account. The bill pay transaction minimum is $10.
























 


The Fine Print




To be eligible to earn all or a portion of the cash incentive as part of the promotional offer “NEW400,” an application for a Basic Business Checking account or a Business Interest Checking account must be submitted between 09/30/2023 at 12:00 am PT and 12/31/2023 at 11:59 pm PT.


Axos Bank reserves the right to limit each primary account holder or business title to one (1) checking account promotional offer per year. Axos Bank or Axos Bank for Nationwide checking customers or Businesses that have held an Axos Bank or UFB or Axos Bank for Nationwide checking or savings account in the past 12 months under the same title are not eligible for this offer.


Promotional terms and conditions are subject to change or removal without notice. Incentive may be taxable and reported on IRS Form 1099-MISC.


Consult your tax advisor. After initial requirements above are met, the amount of incentive earned will depend on meeting the additional requirements outlined below:


Small Business Checking bonus up to $400: You must be approved for your new Basic Business Checking or Business Interest Checking account and fund it within 30 days of account opening. An incentive of up to $400 can be earned during the first five (5) statement cycles. A statement cycle is a calendar month consisting of at least one day your account was open during that month. You can earn a maximum of four (4) payouts during the five (5) statement cycles, and the incentive will be deposited into the qualifying account within 10 business days following the end of the statement cycle in which the balance requirement was met.


$75 will be earned for each statement cycle, up to $300 when you meet three requirements: 1) the average daily balance in your Basic Business Checking account or Business Interest Checking Account is between $25,000 and $49,999.99, 2) you have completed ten (10) point-of-sale transactions per month using your Small Business Checking Visa® Debit Card for signature-based purchases with a minimum of $3 per transaction, 3) You must also have bill pay set up and connected to your Basic Business Checking account or Business Interest Checking account. The bill pay transaction minimum is $10.


$100 will be earned for each statement cycle, up to $400 when you meet three requirements : 1) the average daily balance in your Basic Business Checking account or Business Interest Checking Account is greater than $50,000, 2) you have completed ten (10) point-of-sale transactions per month using your Small Business Checking Visa® Debit Card for signature-based purchases with a minimum of $3 per transaction, 3) You must also have bill pay set up and connected to your Basic Business Checking account or Business Interest Checking account.


The bill pay transaction minimum is $10.


Your Small Business Checking account must remain open and in good standing at the time the incentive is paid to be eligible. Furthermore, your Small Business Checking account must remain open for 150 days, or an early closure fee of up to $400 may apply.




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This checking account does not have any monthly fees.


Early Account Termination Fee


Account must be kept open for 180 days otherwise a $50 fee will apply.


Our Verdict


Axos has offered a bonus of up to $67.50 before via Swagbucks
. This bonus is better but most people won’t be eligible due to it needing to be a newly incorporated business. Obviously not worth doing that for such a small bonus. We will still add it to the best business checking bonuses for those that are eligible as the requirements are easy to meet.

There is also a $100 referral bonus when you spend $1,000 on the debit card, I do not think these offers stack
















The Fine Print




Account must be opened by 10/31/2024.


This offer is valid through 12/31/2024 and is limited to one reward per account.


Incentive rewards are deposited into your Found account on or before 30 days of meeting the incentive requirements.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so unsure if there is any EATF.


Our Verdict


Feel free to share your referrals in the comments below, I don’t think it’s possible to stack the bonuses though and actually think the $125 bonus might be easier for most people.

TD Bank is offering a $500 bonus when you open a new business checking account and complete the following requirements:



Deposit a minimum of $2,500 within the first 25 days and maintain at least a $2,500 balance for 90 additional days from the 25th day after account opening.


Conduct 25 qualifying transactions across the first 3 statement cycles (ACH debits/credits, bill pay, Merchant Solutions settlement transactions, incoming/outgoing wires, checks paid, small business Zelle transactions, Visa Business Debit card transactions, digital express remote deposits, and settlement transactions for TD Online Accounting or Tap-to-Pay on iPhone payments received)




















The Fine Print




Offer valid October 1, 2024 through November 30, 2024 and is available when opening a qualified Checking account at a TD Store or online.


Checking Bonus: You will not qualify for the Checking Bonus if you are an existing TD Bank Business Checking customer OR had a previous Business Checking Account that was closed within the preceding 12 months OR have received a prior Business Checking account bonus at any time. Eligibility is determined based on the SSN/TIN of the business used to open the account.


To qualify for the $500 Cash Back Offer: You must open a new Business Checking account. Business Simple Checking, Business Convenience Checking Plus, Business Interest Checking Plus or Business Premier Checking products are eligible. The criteria below must also be met:



Deposit a minimum of $2,500 within the first 25 days and maintain at least a $2,500 balance for 90 additional days from the 25th day after account opening.


Conduct 25 qualifying transactions across the first 3 statement cycles. Your eligible transactions include ACH debits/credits, bill pay, Merchant Solutions settlement transactions, incoming/outgoing wires, checks paid, small business Zelle transactions, Visa Business Debit card transactions, digital express remote deposits, and settlement transactions for TD Online Accounting or Tap-to-Pay on iPhone payments received.






After you have completed the requirements outlined above, we’ll deposit the bonus in your new account on or before 180 days after account opening. To receive the bonus, your account must not be closed or restricted at the time of payout. If your new checking account is closed by you or TD Bank within 6 months after account opening, TD Bank reserves the right to deduct the bonus amount at closing.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees




TD Business Simple Checking Account Guide has a $10 monthly fee that can’t be waived


TD Business Convenience Checking Plus Account has a $15 monthly fee, this is waived with  $1,500 in Combined balances in TD Business Convenience Checking

Plus and one personal checking




Early Account Termination Fee


In their 
online fee schedule
, there is no mention of an early account termination fee. The fine print does say the accounts need to be kept open for 6 months or the bonus is forfeit though.


Our Verdict


Think this is the first time we’ve seen a business checking bonus. There is a 
$300 personal checking & $200 savings bonus
. Bonus itself is a bit tedious but worth doing if you’re eligible. I’ll add this to our 
best bank bonus
 page.

M&T Bank is offering a bonus of $500 when you open a new Tailored Business Checking account and complete the following requirements:



Have an Average Ledger Balance in the account is at least $15,000 in the third full calendar month after the account was opened


$300 bonus when you have an Average Ledger Balance in the account is at least $5,000+ in the third full calendar month after the account was opened


$1,5000 bonus when you have an Average Ledger Balance in the account is at least $100,000+ in the third full calendar month after the account was opened










 


 


The Fine Print




We will credit $500 bonus (the “Checking Bonus”) to a new M&T Tailored Business Checking account opened between 1/1/2023 and 3/31/2023 if the Average Ledger Balance in the account is at least $5,000 in the third full calendar month after the account was opened. If the requirements are met and the Account remains open, the Checking Bonus will be credited to the Account within 45 days after the end of the third full calendar month after the account was opened. The Checking Bonus is reportable for tax purposes and is not available to employees of M&T Bank or any of its affiliates. The Checking Bonus is not available to customers who have had a non-personal M&T checking account within the previous 90 days of opening an M&T Tailored Business Checking account. Only one Checking Bonus will be awarded per customer regardless of the number of new M&T Tailored Business Checking accounts opened. A $50 Account Closure Fee applies if the account is closed within the time period referenced in the Commercial Deposit Account Fee Schedule.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This account has a $20 monthly fee. This is waived if you:




Maintain a $10,000 monthly average ledger balance


Maintain $25,000 average ledger balance between checking & savings


Make $2,000 in purchases on a linked M&T business credit card


M&T bank merchant services account proceeds deposited




Early Account Termination Fee


$50 if closed within 180 days of date opened, bonus forfeit if closed within six months as well


Our Verdict


Update; You need $15,000 in the account to trigger the bonus, making the return even worse unfortunately.


You will need to keep $10,000 in this account to keep it fee free and to trigger the bonus (or you could put $5,000 into the account and just pay the monthly fees). Either way the deal is still worth doing as the bonus is for $500.
 Keep in mind M&T also offer personal bonuses of up to $300 as well
. I will be adding this to 
our list of the best business bank account bonuses
.

Early Account Termination Fee


Thes accounts needs to be kept open for a minimum of six months, otherwise you will forfeit the bonus.


Our Verdict


Sometimes you can get a bonus of $500 for opening a fast track business checking account, the nice thing about that offer is that it’s a lot easier to keep fee free. This $750 bonus is as high as the accelerated bonus goes. Keep in mind you’d need to keep $25,000 deposited for six months to keep the bonus and avoid any fees.  There are no fees for the first three months so you’d really just want to deposit $20,000 then withdraw it and then add $25,000 again later to keep it fee free  (or just pay $90 in fees). If you put that into an account earning 2% APY you’d earn $125  I will add this to  the list of the 
best business checking bonuses available
 because this is as high as this bonus goes. There is also a 
$200 personal checking bonus
 that is worth doing (not currently available sadly. Hopefully somebody finds a working link). People have successfully gotten both the business & personal checking account bonuses before.

Avoiding Fees


Business Checking ($400 Bonus)


This account has a monthly fee of $12 and is waived if you do ONE of the following:




Make $1,000 in business credit card purchases with a linked PNC credit card


Maintain an average minimum monthly collected balance of $500




Treasury Enterprise Plan ($1,000 Bonus)


This account has a monthly fee of $50. This is waived when you maintain $30,000 Average Combined Monthly Collected Balance in the master and all additional beneficiary business checking accounts


Early Account Termination Fee


. None


Our Verdict


The standard bonus is $200
, the 
best bonus we’ve seen was $400
 and that only required a deposit of $10,000 to trigger. I’m not sure if we will see that offer again, but it’s significantly better than the $500 bonus. I’ll still add these bonuses to the 
best bank bonus
 page but it might be better to wait for a possible return of that $400 offer.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Business Foundation ($100)


This account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Business Core ($400)












Business core has a $20 monthly fee, waived the first two months. After that is waived if you meet any of the following:




Maintain average monthly balance of $5,000


Hold $20,000 in average relationship balances.


Utilize an Associated Bank Merchant Services Account




Business Advanced Checking ($700)


Monthly maintenance fee of $35, waived by:




Maintaining an average monthly balance of $15,000 OR


Average relationship balances⁵ of $75,000 OR


Utilize an Associated Bank Merchant Services Account




Early Account Termination Fee


Account needs to be kept open for 12 months otherwise bonus is forfeit.


Our Verdict


Previous best bonus was a 
$300 referral
 but requirements were significantly easier. If you put $15,000 into a 5% account for 12 months (this is required for the $750 bonus to keep fee free) you’d miss out on $750 in lost interest, so that one is not worth considering (keep in mind you’d need $20,000 in there for the first three months to trigger the bonus). $400 bonus you’d miss out on $250 so that one is barely worth considering either. I’d probably just give this one a miss and hope for a bigger bonus to come along.

Truist Bank is offering a bonus of $300 when you open a new business checking account and complete the following requirements:



Use promo code 
SB24Q4CHECKING


Make cumulative qualifying deposits of 
 $2,000+


Enroll and Sign In to Truist Online Banking for Business within 30 days of account opening.










 


The Fine Print




Open a new Truist Simple Business Checking or Dynamic Business Checking account online or in a branch from March 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022. Within 30 days of opening the new business checking account, you must:


Make cumulative Qualifying Deposits* of $1,500 or more into your new account.

Enrollment in the promotion is required at the time of account opening, using promo code SB22NEW2BIZ2, in order to be eligible for a promotion reward.


Please refer to the Account Opening and Enrollment section below for instructions.


Qualifying Deposits for new business checking accounts exclude debit card credit transactions and NSF fee refunds. Deposits can be made on a one-time basis or cumulatively over the 30 days.


The new business checking account must remain open and in good standing with a balance ≥$0.00 until the reward is processed in order to receive the reward. Reward forfeiture will occur if: (1) the business checking account is changed to an account type not included in this client offer, (2) the business checking account is closed prior to the reward being processed, or (3) the new business checking account has a negative available balance at the time of qualification validation. Truist reserves the right to deduct the reward amount from the business checking account at the time of closing if the new business checking account is closed by the client or Truist within 180 days after opening.


You must be a new Truist business checking client. To be considered a new business checking client, the business cannot have an existing Truist business checking account with the same Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), including but not limited to an Employer Identification Number (EIN), prior to promotion start or have closed a business account within 180 days of the promotion start date (on or after September 2, 2021).


The business account holder must be 18 years or older at time of account opening.


The account holder cannot be a non-resident alien.

The qualifying checking account must be opened in a Truist branch in one of the above-listed states or online.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Simple business checking account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


. No longer any EATF.


Our Verdict


Truist is the new name for the merged BB&T and SunTrust bank
. BB&T has offered a $300 bonus in the past and SunTrust has offered a $400 bonus in the past. Now that this bonus is $400, it’s definitely worth doing.

Our Verdict


Not sure if this is targeted towards the people who have done the 
$100 personal checking bonus
, or open to everybody as long as you use the promo code. If anybody goes for this deal then please share your experiences in the comments below. I won’t be adding this to the 
best bank account bonuses
 until we know if it’s open to everybody or not.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Receive a sign up bonus of $150 when you open a new Dividend Business Checking Account with Provident Credit Union and complete the following requirements:



File account opening paperwork with the promotional code 9982


Add at least $2,500 in deposits within 60 days of account opening


Make purchases of $300 or more using a Provident Business debit card per month


Enroll in online banking and e-Documents with valid email address




















 


The Fine Print




You must be a new business member, 18 or older and reside in California


You are not eligible if you are a current owner on a Provident Credit Union business account or if you have been an owner on a Provident Credit Union business account within the last six months


One New Business Account Bonus per business. To be eligible, you must open a Dividend Business Checking Account


In order to qualify for your New Business Account Bonus your account must be active and in good standing for two consecutive months following the month that your Dividend Business Checking account is opened


All qualifying purchases and transactions referred to as “per month” or “monthly” only count towards the requirement of the month in which they POST, which will be on a business day (Monday – Friday) and may take one or more business days from the purchase/transaction date


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


No Monthly Fee


The dividend business checking does not have any monthly fee to worry about.


Membership Enrollment $10


If you enroll with provident then you must pay a $10 membership enrollment fee. Although apparently it’s possible to get this waived if you apply online.




Early Account Termination Fee $0


None of the provident checking accounts come with an early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


I’m reposting because this account no longer has any monthly fee to worry about (previously it required a deposit of $15,000). Because of that change it’s now definitely worth doing (thanks to reader 
Lrdx
 for pointing this out) I’m going to add this to 
our list of the best business checking bonuses
.

Another bank where we need to know if it’s a hard or soft pull. It’s a shame you need a direct deposit and need to keep the account open for 12 months to get the full bonus.

Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union is offering $400 checking bonus. Requirements are as follows:



Open a new HVCU Premier or Classic Checking Account with a Visa Debit Card


Sign up for Internet Banking & eStatements


Spend a minimum of $1,500 with your new Debit Card OR make $1,500 in direct deposits into your new account within the first 90 days










The Fine Print




Terms and Conditions Applicable to $400 Bonus Checking Account Offer, valid from 10/2/2023 to 12/31/2023


Account holder has 90 calendar days to meet the requirements to receive bonus. HVCU will deposit the $400 bonus into the account holder’s new checking account within five business days after the completion of the 90 calendar day qualification period, so long as the account holder fulfills each of the following three qualifications:


Open a new checking account with HVCU Visa Debit Card (must be requested at time of account opening);


Enroll in Internet Banking and/or Mobile Banking services and enroll in e-statements;


Use your new HVCU debit card and spend a minimum of $1,500 using the new checking account OR sign up for qualifying direct deposits with a cumulative minimum of $1,500 into your new checking account. A “qualifying direct deposit” is a direct deposit of regular monthly income, such as your salary, pension, or Social Security benefits, which are made by your employer or other payer, using account and routing numbers that you provide to them. Examples of non-qualifying direct deposits and transfers include: your initial ACH deposit to open the account, teller deposits, wire transfers, debit card transfers, ATM transfers or deposits, or Internet or Mobile banking transfers or deposits. Offer subject to member verification.


Only one bonus of $400 will be paid to the primary checking account owner. This must be your first HVCU checking account to qualify for this bonus. Only Personal Classic and Premier checking accounts are eligible for this offer. Members under the age of 18 are not eligible to receive this bonus. No exceptions will be made or considered. Account must be in good standing and the qualifications satisfied to receive bonus. Good standing means you have on deposit at least the par value of one full share ($0.01) in the regular share savings account, have no delinquent loans (payment is not more than 30 days late), and have a positive balance in all share accounts. May be subject to IRS reporting; please consult your tax advisor. HVCU expressly reserves the right to terminate this promotion at its discretion at any time and without further notice provided to you.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Classic checking account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


According to the 
fee schedule
 there is an early account termination fee of $20 if closed within 90 days of account opening.


Our Verdict


Not sure if the credit card funding is still available or not. 
Previous best was the $750 checking bonus
, but that required a direct deposit. Worth doing if you live in an eligible area.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Receive a sign up bonus of $100 when you open a personal checking account with Stanford Federal Credit Union and do the following:



NEW500


Establish a monthly recurring direct deposit of at least $2,500 to your new checking account








Coupon code is generic: segck100su. You can generate your own official coupon by going 
to the Special Offers tab
 and entering your name/email.




The Fine Print




Valid through 12/31/18.


First direct deposit must be received within 60 days of account opening


$5 minimum required to open account


Offer does not apply to second or multiple checking accounts and/or existing checking members and is limited to one bonus per household


Bonus $100 will be credited to your account within 30 days after satisfaction of conditions


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


There is no early account termination fee, but you must keep the account open for a minimum of three months according to the fine print. Their basic checking account has no monthly fees or monthly minimums.


Joining


While the Stanford Federal Credit Union is usually for employer groups in the Stanford area, anybody can actually join. If you join the 
Friends of the Palo Alto Library
 (FOPAL) or 
Museum of American Heritage 
(MOAH), then you’re eligible. When you set up your account in branch, they will even pay the membership fees for you.


Our Verdict


This is a decent promotion (given how easy it is to keep fees down), but unfortunately we don’t know if it’s a hard or soft pull and what counts as a direct deposit. The upside is that an in branch application is required, so you should be able to easily ask whether it’s a hard or soft pull. Because of these unknowns we haven’t added it to

BluPeak Credit Union is offering a $600 checking bonus when you meet the following requirements:



Use promo code SPLASH


Open A Checking Along With A Savings Or Loan


Set Up Qualifying Direct Deposits


Use Your Debit Card For Purchases






Bonus schedule is a bit difficult to understand, see image below.






The Fine Print




The Splash Promotion will begin on 7/8/24 at 9:00 AM PT for a limited time only and must be an active promotion at the time of account opening to participate.


Must be 18 years of age or older at enrollment. Limit one promotion per member and per qualifying consumer checking account.


Must NOT have held a BluPeak consumer checking account since July 8, 2023, must meet all membership and account criteria, and must OPEN a NEW consumer checking account using the promotion code “SPASH” at account opening.


Enter the promotion code “SPLASH” in the online new account opening workflow or mention the promotion code “SPLASH” to the BluPeak new account representative during in person account opening to enroll in the promotion.


Must maintain a balance of at least $.01 in the checking product at the time of each payout evaluation to qualify for each bonus.


Must meet account opening criteria and OPEN a NEW savings product (savings, money market, certificate) or NEW loan product within the same membership as the checking account within 90 days after opening the checking account. Must maintain a balance of at least $.01 on the savings or loan product at the time of each payout evaluation to quality for each bonus.


Must receive at least three (3) qualifying Direct Deposits (as defined below) totaling $3,000 or more in an accountholder’s name AND perform fifteen (15) Debit Card Purchases (as defined below) totaling $150 EVERY NINTY (90) DAYS after account opening to earn a bonus in each 90 day period. If there is a 90 day period where the criteria is not met, you will not be eligible for any additional bonuses. See the above payout table for details.


A qualifying “Direct Deposit” means a recurring electronic deposit of income to an accountholder’s BluPeak Checking account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, benefits provider or government agency via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network that is new to BluPeak (meaning it is not redirected from an existing BluPeak account). Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), investments and bank/credit union funds transfers, and wire transfers, as well as deposits that are non-recurring electronic deposits such as IRS tax refunds, do NOT constitute Direct Deposit activity and a BONUS WILL NOT BE PAID.


“Debit Card Purchase” means a purchase made with your BluPeak debit card. Purchase refunds/reversals, ATM transactions, and bill payments do not qualify.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees












This account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


$15 fee if closed within 90 days of account opening according to the 
fee schedule
.


Our Verdict


Previous best bonus was $300
. It takes awhile to get the full bonus, but the requirements aren’t that difficult basically just keeping the account open once you meet the direct deposit and debit card requirement. We will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

Monthly direct deposits over $500 or


 $500 average ledger balance




Early Account Termination Fee


I didn’t see any mention of the EATF in the

.


Our Verdict


Truist is the new name for the merged BB&T and SunTrust bank
. Keep in mind you won’t be eligible for this bonus if you’ve held a BB&T/SunTrust or Truist account since 2/1/21.
 They launched with a $500 bonus
,  but we haven’t seen that bonus return and normally it’s only $200 so I’d recommend doing this offer and will add to the 
best bank account bonuses
.

Clearview Federal Credit Union is offering a bonus of up to $500. You must use the promo code 
SWITCH




Open an absolute checking account and make a recurring direct deposit of $500 or more within the first 60 days, sign up for eStatements and receive a 
$300 bonus
 (can get a smaller bonus of $200 by opening a simple checking account)


Open one of the above checking accounts and open a savings account money market account, OR a certificate with a 12 month or greater term within 7 business days of checking account opening, deposit $15,000 in new money and maintain that balance for 90 days and receive a 
$100 bonus 


Get a further 
$100 bonus
 on the anniversary date of your checking account opening, as long as a recurring electronic deposit of at least $500 or more is made










The Fine Print




To receive the $200 bonus: Open a Basic or Simple checking account, make a recurring deposit of $500 or more within the first 60 days of account opening, and sign up for eStatements. You’ll receive your bonus once the criteria are met.


B). To receive the $300 bonus: Open an Absolute Checking® account, make a recurring deposit of $500 or more within the first 60 days of account opening, and sign up for eStatements.You’ll receive your bonus once the criteria are met.


C). To receive the additional $100 bonus: Open one of the above checking accounts AND open a Clearview Savings OR Money Market OR a Certificate with a 12 month or greater term within 7 business days of checking account opening, and deposit a total of $15,000 or more in new money. Must maintain a $15,000 average daily balance for 90 days.


You’ll receive your bonus after the 90 day period is over.


D). Get an automatic additional $100 bonus on the anniversary date of your checking account opening, as long as you maintain a recurring electronic deposit of at least $500 or more.


The bonus(es) will be reported to the IRS for tax purposes. Use promo code: switch


Offer is only valid for new members age 18 and older with a savings account and Basic, Simple, or Absolute Checking account.


This offer is available online. You may take advantage of this offer at a financial center by appointment only.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Absolute Checking












The absolute checking account has a $10 monthly fee. This is waived if you do one of the following




Maintain a $10,000 combined balance among all your Clearview deposits (savings, checking, IRAs and certificates)


a $20,000 combined balance of your deposits and loans or


deposit $5,000 or more in total direct deposits during the month




Simple Checking


This account has a $3 monthly fee. This is waived with $500 in monthly direct deposits or five monthly transactions


Early Account Termination Fee


There is an 
early account termination fee of $10
 if the account is closed within 90 days


Our Verdict


Money market account earns 0.85%. If you deposit the $15,000 required into the savings account for 90 days this works out to be an additional ~2.7% for a total of 3.55%. Not bad, but not fantastic either. For most people it’ll make sense to just focus on the $400 in checking bonuses that are available. The main issue is keeping the absolute checking account fee free, especially when you need to keep the account open for the full year to get the bonus. It might make sense to just do the simple checking account for a smaller bonus or forgetting about the anniversary bonus entirely. Previously 
Clearview has offered a $200 bonus
. I’ll be adding this to our list of the 
best checking account bonuses
.

Avoiding Fees


There are no monthly fees on this account, it does need to stay open for at least 90 days otherwise you’ll be charged a $30 early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


This bonus is now significantly better than it once was due to the requirements being lowered (before you need to have made a lot of debit card purchases to get the full bonus and spend a total of $1,200). The money market bonus is also worth doing. We will add this to 
our best bank bonus page

1300 for the $400 checking bonus
)




Associated Bank  is offering a bonus of up to $600 when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Receive recurring direct deposits totaling $500 or more within 90 days of account opening


Bonus you receive depends on your average daily balance (days 31-90):



Total average daily balances of $1,000-$4,999.99 will earn $300,


$5,000-$9,999.99 will earn $400,


over $10,000 will earn $600.














 




 


The Fine Print




Offer limited to a new personal Associated Bank checking account opened and funded through May 31, 2021.


Receive up to $500 bonus with required minimum opening deposit (Associated Access Checking: $25, Associated Balanced or Choice Checking: $100; deposits from existing accounts do not qualify) and direct deposits totaling $500 or more within 90 days of account opening.


Determining your bonus: 90 days (or the previous business day), after opening your checking account, we will calculate the sum of the average daily balance for all your open Associated Bank deposit accounts for days 31-90. Total average daily balances of $1,000-$4,999.99 will earn $200, $5,000-$9,999.99 will earn $300, over $10,000 will earn $500.


All personal Associated Bank checking, savings, money market, IRA and/or CD account balances are included in the calculation to determine your total average deposit balance. Accounts must be titled with the same primary account holder to qualify for the bonus. Deposit balances from business, HSA, investment, minor or private banking accounts are ineligible.


The bonus will be deposited into the new Associated Bank checking account within 120 days of account opening.


Account must be open at the time the bonus is paid and must remain open for a minimum of 12 months.

Offer not available for customers who have received a new personal checking account monetary bonus within the last 24 months and have or have had an Associated Bank checking account within the last 12 months.


Associated Bank colleagues are not eligible.


Primary owner on the account must be 18 years or older to qualify.


Person to Person payments and transfers from external accounts do not qualify for the required direct deposit transactions to receive the monetary bonus.

The offer is subject to change, at Associated Bank’s discretion, at any time without notice and other exclusions may apply.




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Associated access checking account has no monthly fees to worry about. You do need to opt into eStatements otherwise you’ll be charged $4.


Early Account Termination Fee


There is no early account termination fee, but the account needs to be open  for 12 months or the bonus is forfeit.


$50 Referral Bonus


You can also refer friends if you 
visit here
. Previously you’ve been able to get referred and also get the bonus, it looks like that will stack as well because the brewers referlive page specifically mentions the $500 bonus. In addition person signing up for the account can get a Christian Yelich bobblehead (these are going for $20-$50 on eBay, but I imagine price will come down). Please do not ask for or share your referrals in the comments. 
Instead you can use this dedicated page
.


Our Verdict


We’ve seen previous bonuses of 
$175 + $100
 and 
$400
. This new offer is for more money and you don’t need to open a savings account (but you do need a high average daily balance for 30 days, but still less than the previous $400 offer). The other offers had direct deposit optional though. I still think this is the best offer by far and will be adding it to the 
best bank bonus page
.

Monthly Fees


ONB Everyday ($300 Bonus)


ONB Everyday, this has a $6.95 monthly fee that is waived if you do any of the following:




Have a total of $500 in direct deposits each month


Maintain a minimum daily balance of $750


Maintain a combined balance of $1,500 in checking, savings or money market accounts

Previously best offer was a $200 bonus

best bank account bonuses
.

Our Verdict


Online sign up seems to allow nationwide opening, but all branches are in NY & PA. We need to know if it’s a hard or soft pull and the direct deposit requirement is somewhat confusing as well.

There is a $300 bonus but that is only for veterans
. 
They have offered a $200 bonus in the past as well
. Nice thing about this is another $150 gets donated to a school program as well. Even though this is smaller than previous bonuses I’ll still probably add this to 
our list of the best checking account bonuses

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fees to worry about


Early Account Termination Fee


There is no EATF in the 
fee schedule
.


Our Verdict


Last time SECU offered a bonus it was available nationwide with a donation
, but terms have specific states listed this time unfortunately. This is an extra $50 and requirements are roughly the same. Worth doing and we will add it to the 
best bank bonuses
.

Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fees, according to the fee schedule a reader sent us


Early Account Termination Fee


There is no early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


Previously the best offer we have seen has been $100 and another $50 for opening a savings account, so this bonus is significantly better. This bonus is definitely worth doing as it’s nice big bonus and the requirements aren’t too difficult to meet. Because of that we will add it to the 
best checking bonus page
.

Checking offer not available to existing MidFirst Bank consumer checking customers.


Savings offer available to new consumer checking customers and existing MidFirst Bank consumer checking customers that meet offer requirements.


Accounts must be open and in good standing to receive an account credit.


Promotional offers are not available to those whose MidFirst accounts have been closed during the current or previous calendar year or previously closed at any time with a negative balance. Checking and savings offers are limited to one checking and savings offer per household.

. Account credits are considered interest and will be reported on IRS Form 1099-INT, or applicable tax form. Account openings are subject to MidFirst Bank’s approval.


 Accounts closed within 90 days of opening may forfeit the amount equal to the promotional account credit received.


Checking Offer: Open a new qualifying consumer checking account and receive $200 when you complete ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO OPTIONS within 90 days of account opening: 1) Have direct deposits totaling $500 or more made to your new account. Direct deposit must be an electronic deposit of the account owner’s paycheck, pension or government benefits, such as Social Security. Electronic deposits made from one consumer account to another do not qualify, such as Zelle®, PayPal®, Venmo®, or small-dollar verification transactions. OR 2) Complete 10 debit card purchase transactions with your MidFirst Bank debit card AND three Zelle® transactions in the MidFirst Mobile App. Multiple swipes for the same purchase amount or at the same merchant in succession do not qualify for eligible debit card purchase transactions. Credit will be made to new account within 30 days of meeting checking requirements 1 OR 2.


Savings Offer: New and existing MidFirst Bank consumer checking customers can open a new Summit Savings account and receive $100 when you complete the following: 1) Deposit a total of $10,000 or more in funds new to MidFirst Bank within 10 days of account opening and 2) Maintain at least $10,000 balance in new account for 90 days. Credit will be made to new Summit Savings account within 30 days of meeting savings requirements 1 AND 2.

Avoiding Fees


The M checking account required for this bonus has a $6 monthly fee, this is waived with a  $250 or more monthly recurring direct deposit or $1,000 minimum average daily balance


Early Account Termination Fee


Account must be kept open for 90 days to avoid any early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


Previously we saw a bonus of $300 that didn’t require a direct deposit. I’d recommend waiting for that offer to return as the $100 savings bonus isn’t worth considering at the moment with 
interest rates so high

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Fidelity Bank is offering a bonus of $200 when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements within 150 days of account opening:



Set up your account with direct deposits or recurring credits of $2,500 per month for three consecutive months


client is enrolled in EZ Statements and


15 point-of-sale debit card transactions per month are completed






Use your Fidelity Visa® Debit Card at qualifying merchants an additional 60 times over a 3 consecutive month period and earn $100


Open a new Fidelity Bank savings account at the same time with a minimum of $15,000 and earn an additional $200.


Open your new Fidelity Bank checking account online and earn $25




The Fine Print




Offer valid for new personal checking account customers only.


A $500.00 deposit will be made into your Fidelity Bank checking account when direct deposits or recurring credits of $3,000.00 per month are received for a minimum of three (3) consecutive months.


Requirement must be satisfied within one hundred and fifty (150) calendar days of account opening.


Deposit will be made on the first (1st) business day after one hundred and fifty (150) calendar days from account opening.


Minimum deposit to open a checking account may range between $25.00 and $1,000.00, minimum balance requirements and monthly service charges depend on which checking account is chosen.


Please consult your Fidelity Banker for specific product information. Minimum balance requirements and fees may reduce earnings.


The annual percentage yield (APY) for Performance Checking or Platinum Checking accounts is 0.05% if balance requirement of $2,500.00 is met. APY is current as of May 20, 2019 and may be rescinded or changed at any time.


Rates are variable and may change at any time.


Bonus will be reported on IRS Form 1099-Misc.


Cannot be combined with any other offer.


Customers may only receive one new checking account and savings account opening-related bonus per calendar year.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Reliance Checking $7 Monthly Fee


This account is the easiest to keep fee free, the $7 monthly charged is waived if you do any of the following:




$1500 average daily balance OR


$400 aggregated monthly direct deposit


or ten (10) signature based Fidelity Visa® Check Card transactions




Early Account Termination Fee


There is a fee if closed within 180 days, but I’m unsure what this fee is.


Our Verdict


Previous best bonus was $200
, that required a savings account but lower direct deposit/recurring credit. This new bonus is significantly better because the bonus is $400 and the direct deposit/recurring credit isn’t that difficult to meet. Because of that we will be adding this to 
our list of the best bank bonuses
.

Open a new checking account with bankESB and receive a bonus of up to $300. Bonus is broken down as follows:



$150 promotional offer is for enrolling in eStatements and having a minimum of $1,000 in aggregate direct deposits posted to the account OR enrolling in eStatements and conducting a minimum of 25 point of sale (POS) debit card transactions of $10 or more posted to the account within the first 90 days of account opening. The bonus will be credited to the account by the last day of the statement cycle following the 90th day the account was opened.


$150 loyalty bonus will be paid after the account has been open for 12 months if the account is still enrolled in eStatements and has an active recurring direct deposit posted to the account within the last statement cycle OR if the account is still enrolled in eStatements and has an active debit card (defined as 5 point of sale (POS) transactions of $10 or more posted to the account within the last statement cycle). The loyalty bonus will be credited to the account by the last day of the statement cycle following the 365th day the account was opened.










 


The Fine Print




$100.00 promotional offer
 is for opening a personal checking account and activating direct deposit (of at least $25.00) or signing up for online banking and conducting 5 debit card transactions using your debit card within the first 60 days of account opening ($100.00 will be credited to the account by the last day of the statement cycle following the 60th day the account has been open).


 
$50.00 promotional offer
 is for making 5 bill payments using online banking and enrolling in eStatements within 60 days of account opening ($50.00 will be credited to the account by the last day of the statement cycle following the 60th day the account has been open).


Minors (anyone under the age of 18) are not eligible for Online Bill Pay.


$50.00 loyalty bonus
 will be paid after the account has been open for 12 months ($50.00 will be credited to the account by the last day of the statement cycle following the 365th day the account has been open).


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


The basic checking account doesn’t have any monthly fees, it makes sense to just keep this account open for at least a year so you get the $50 anniversary bonus as well. There is a $10 early account termination fee if the account is closed within six months.


Our Verdict


This is a great bonus, it’s a soft pull and you can fund with a credit card and there is no direct deposit requirement. Only downside is that you have to wait 365 days to get the last $50, but not really a big deal because there is no monthly fee on the basic checking account. We’ve added this to 
our list of the best bank account bonuses
 because of how good it is.


They’ve previously had a similar $200 deal, but it required referring somebody so this is a lot less hassle for people.

The Offer












Direct link to offer




Citizens Bank is offering a bonus of up to $400 when you open a new checking account. Bonus is broken down as follows:



Get $400 when you open your first new personal checking account and make a direct deposit of $1,000 or more within 60 days.












The Fine Print




To earn a $300 bonus, open your first new personal checking account between 08/17/20 to 11/26/20 and have at least one single direct deposit of $500 or more post to your new checking account within 60 days of account opening.


To earn up to $100: Get paid $2 per qualified debit transaction (up to $100) that post and clear your new checking account within 60 days of account opening.


Qualifications: Primary signer on the new checking account may not be or have been a signer on any Citizens Bank personal checking account within the previous six months.


The new account must be open and in good standing on the payout date stated in the table below to qualify for this offer.


Direct Deposit is recurring income electronically deposited into your Citizens Bank checking account and may include salary, pension, and other regular income.


Qualified debit card transactions include signature and PIN-based debit transactions in person directly at a merchant location or in app or online merchant sites.


Only one debit card per checking account eligible for bonus. Online Bill Payments, Zelle® transactions and ATM transactions do not qualify.


Eligibility: Customer must open their first new checking account via Citizens Bank’s online account opening system accessed by clicking on one of the links on this page.


Customer should print this screen for their records. Customer will only be paid a one-time bonus for this program.


Offers may be withdrawn without notice and cannot be combined with any other checking offer.


Payout: Bonus will be deposited to the new checking account by the date stated in the table below and will be labeled as “Balance Builder Bonus”.


Bonus will be reported to the IRS for income tax purposes.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Need to sign up for online statements otherwise there is a $3 fee.


Monthly Fees


Citizens Bank One Deposit Checking Account $9.99 Monthly Fee


The One Deposit checking account comes with a $9.99 monthly fee. Fee is waived by making one deposit each statement period. (
According to this comment they really do count any deposit
 – even a transfer from another Citizens Bank account will trigger this.)


Early Account Termination Fee


As far as we know there is no early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


We’ve seen a $600 bonus in the past, but that required a $15,000 deposit to get the full bonus. This is a better option for those without that extra money sitting around. We will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

Account must be in an open status and in good standing at the time of payout.


Your direct deposit needs to be an electronic deposit of your paycheck, pension or government benefits (such as Social Security) from your employer or the government.

Please consult your tax advisers concerning the reporting to Internal Revenue Service of bonus payments as interest on accounts. Offer expires 12/31/2022.

Our Verdict


Previously they offered a targeted $100 checking bonus
. This bonus should be worth doing for people that haven’t done the 
bigger bonuses available

Santander is offering a $400 checking bonus when you open a Santander Select checking account and complete the following requirements:



have $5,000 or more in direct deposits within the first 90 days










The Fine Print




Get $400 when you open a new Santander Select® Checking, Simply Right® Checking, or Santander® Private Client Checking account ($25 minimum opening deposit on all) by 10/03/2023 and have direct deposits totaling $5,000 or more post to this account within the first 90 days.


Account must be opened in a branch.


The 90 day period begins the day of account opening, unless the account is opened on a weekend or holiday, in which case the period begins on the first business day after account opening.


Offer is transferable until redeemed by the addressee and we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the number of times this Promotion Code may be used. You must be 18 years or older.


Offer is not available if any account owner is a current checking customer of Santander or had a Santander checking account in the last 12 months prior to account opening.

The account must remain open in an eligible account type until payment of bonus, which will occur within 30 days thereafter.


In addition, the account must remain open and in good standing to be bonus eligible. Bonus is considered interest and will be reported to the IRS on Form 1099-INT.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees




Simply Right has a $10 monthly Fee, waived with one transaction* – a deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or payment – posted during the calendar month.




Early Account Termination Fee


$25 if closed within 90 days


Our Verdict


Not as good as the 
last $500 bonus
. Although the direct deposit requirement is lower for the $400 tier. In any case a lot of people try to cycle these santander bonuses so if you’re eligible it’s probably worth just taking this bonus as I doubt we will see anything better in the short term.We will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses

Direct link to offer




Popular Community Bank is offering a bonus of up to $700 when you open a new checking account. Bonus is as follows:



Checking bonus:



Earn $150 When you open a new Popular Easy Access Checking account, link two direct deposits (such as your paycheck or government benefits), and make 12 everyday purchases (like your morning coffee) in the first 90 days


Earn $300 When you open a new Popular Everyday Checking account, link two direct deposits (such as your paycheck or pension), and make 12 everyday purchases (like your weekly supermarket run) in the first 90 days.


Earn $500 When you open a new Popular Prestige Checking account, link two direct deposits (such as your paycheck or government benefits), and make 12 everyday purchases (like your dinner delivery) in the first 90 days






Earn a $200 bonus when you open a new Popular Savings account, deposit a minimum of $8,000 in new money in the first 30 days, and keep a $8,000 average monthly balance for two statement cycles. Must have or open a Popular Bank consumer checking account to qualify




















The Fine Print




All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees




Easy Access Checking. $3 OR $0 if you set up a recurring monthly direct deposit of $250


Everyday Checking. $10 OR $0 if you maintain $1,000 in average monthly balances5 or set up a recurring monthly direct deposit of $750.


Prestige Checking. $12 OR $0 if you maintain $2,000 in average monthly balances.




Early Account Termination Fee


There is an early account termination fee of $25 if closed within 6 months.


Our Verdict


$500 checking bonus is very good as it’s not difficult to meet the requirements to keep the account fee free. $200 savings bonus is worth doing as well as you only need to tie up funds for ~two months. Will add these to our 
best bank bonuses
. I’d be surprised if these offers don’t get pulled early so sign up ASAP if interested.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees




Flagstar ready checking account has no monthly fee when you opt into eStatements


Flagstar Elite Checking has a $15 monthly service charge, waived when you maintain a $25,000 combined monthly average balance in your Flagstar personal deposit accounts




Early Account Termination Fee


Bonus is forfeit if account is closed within 180 days


Our Verdict


Previously there was a $250 bonus that didn’t require a direct deposit
. Seems to be available in more states now due to the NYCB merger. The $350 checking bonus isn’t worth considering due to the $25,000 deposit requirement to keep the account fee free (remember account needs to be kept open for 180 days to avoid the closure fee). If you put those funds into a 
high yield account
 earning 5% you’d earn $625. We will add this bonus to our 
best bank account bonuses
.

Looks like any ACH credit will work rather than it having to be payroll or government benefits. Considering it’s a soft pull, if you live in the area this is well worth doing as it’s easy to meet bonus requirements and keep the account fee free.

South State Bank is offering a $200 checking bonus when you meet the following requirements within 60 days of account opening:



Use promo code EARN200


Have total qualifying direct deposits of $250 
OR
 monthly automatic draft of $25


Make a minimum of 15 debit card purchases or payments




















 


 


The Fine Print




Eligibility & Qualifications for the Promotional Rebate Offer: To receive the $100, you must meet each of the following criteria:



At account opening, you cannot be a current owner or joint owner of a SouthState personal checking account, or have been an owner or joint owner of a SouthState personal checking account in the past 12 months.


You must open the account with a minimum opening deposit of $25.00 (excluding the Promotional Rebate amount).


Within 60 days of opening the checking account have either: monthly cumulative direct deposits of at least $250 which includes salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular recurring monthly income. (Note, however, that internal account transfers, deposits made at banking locations, by mobile deposits and ATM deposits do not qualify as a direct deposit.) OR one or more automatic draft of at least $25 to a non-South State Bank account.


Have 15 or more posted and cleared debit card purchases/payments from the account.






Promotional Rebate Payment: If you meet all of the Eligibility and Qualifications above, we will credit the Promotional Rebate to your Account within 2 business days of the completion of the 60 calendar day qualifying period. The Promotional Rebate will be reported to the appropriate taxing authorities, as required by law or regulation.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


South State Checking


This account has no monthly fees when you enroll in eStatements


Choice Checking Account $8 Monthly Fee


This is the easiest account to keep fee free fr most people. It has a $8 monthly fee that is waived if you do any of the following:




5 debit card purchases/payments per statement cycle
 
or


$250 in combined direct deposits, 
or


$1,000 average daily balance




Early Account Termination Fee


$25 if closed within 90 days
.


Our Verdict


Reasonably good deal as no direct deposit is required, obviously not the 
biggest bank account bonus
 but still worth doing if you’ve done the more lucrative bonuses. As always if you have any experiences with this bank or bonus then please share them in the comments below.

Numerica Credit Union is offering a $300 bonus when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Use promo code 
MACQ0125


Complete one or both of the following:



Meet Bonus Checking account qualifiers for two consecutive monthly qualification cycles: (a) 
make 12 transactions of $5 or more
 that settle to your account using your Numerica Visa debit or credit card, and (b) receive your statements electronically (eStatements).


And/or make a minimum of 
one direct deposit per month for two consecutive months totaling $500 or more
. Direct deposits need to be an electronic deposit of your paycheck, pension, or government benefits (such as Social Security) from your employer or the government. Person-to-person payments (PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, etc.) are not considered a direct deposit














The Fine Print




*To receive the $200 bonus, you must:



(a) Open a Bonus Checking account by Dec. 31, 2024, using promo code MACQ0624.


(b) Set up a recurring deposit to your new Bonus Checking account within 30 days of account opening.






The second instance of your recurring deposit activates the bonus. A $200 deposit will be made to your Bonus Checking account the day following the second deposit. Existing Numerica members do not qualify for the $200 bonus. You must qualify for membership. Limit one $200 bonus per individual (based on Social Security Number).


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them

Looks like opening out of state does work

Our Verdict


Last year they offered a bonus of $250 and it didn’t require the debit card transactions
. This new deal is probably not worth doing due to the mixed datapoints of it being a hard pull. Feel free to share your referral information in the comments below, but for now we won’t be adding it to the 
best checking bonus page

Direct link to offer




OneAZ Credit Union is offering a bonus of $300 when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Have monthly direct deposit totaling $1,000 or more made to this account within 60 days of account opening








 




The Fine Print




To receive the $300 bonus, you must 1) Open a NEW checking account AND 2) Have monthly direct deposit totaling $500 or more made to this account within 60 days of account opening.


Important Information: Your direct deposit must be an electronic deposit of your paycheck, investment account, pension or government benefits (such as Social Security) from your employer or government agency.


After all the above requirements have been met, we will deposit the $300 bonus in your new checking account within 14 business days.


Bonuses are considered dividends and will be reported on IRS form 1099-INT (or Form 1042-S, if applicable).


Offer is not available to existing OneAZ Credit Union members.


This offer is not transferable and cannot be combined with any other promotions.




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Arizona checking account is the easiest to keep fee free (outside of the student account). The $7 monthly fee is waived if you do any of the following:




One or more direct deposit transaction(s) each month OR


ten or more debit card purchases a month OR


minimum $2,000 aggregate average daily balance in checking, savings and/or money market deposits OR


minimum $10,000 aggregate month-end loan balances




Early Account Termination Fee


Account must be kept open for six months otherwise you will forfeit the bonus


Our Verdict


This has now been confirmed to be a soft pull (even says so in the disclosures during sign up), I’d still opt out of overdraft protection but overall this bonus is well worth doing and we will add it to 
our list of the best checking bonuses
.

The Fine Print




Valid through 12/31/18.


First direct deposit must be received within 60 days of account opening


$5 minimum required to open account

Bonus $100 will be credited to your account within 30 days after satisfaction of conditions

Avoiding Fees


There is no early account termination fee, but you must keep the account open for a minimum of three months according to the fine print. Their basic checking account has no monthly fees or monthly minimums.


Joining


While the Stanford Federal Credit Union is usually for employer groups in the Stanford area, anybody can actually join. If you join the 
Friends of the Palo Alto Library
 (FOPAL) or 
Museum of American Heritage 
(MOAH), then you’re eligible. When you set up your account in branch, they will even pay the membership fees for you.


Our Verdict


This is a decent promotion (given how easy it is to keep fees down), but unfortunately we don’t know if it’s a hard or soft pull and what counts as a direct deposit. The upside is that an in branch application is required, so you should be able to easily ask whether it’s a hard or soft pull. Because of these unknowns we haven’t added it to 
our best bank bonus page
.


We have added it to

Maintain direct deposit for a minimum of 3 months (90 days) after first direct deposit transaction.




Bonus Payment:

Direct link to offer




Camden National Bank is offering a $300 bonus when you open a new Rewards OR Premier checking account and complete the following requirements:



Receive a direct deposit of $500+ within 60 days of account opening




















The Fine Print




To be eligible for account bonus you must open either a Rewards or Premier checking account between September 9 and November 15, 2024.


You must be an individual of at least 18 years of age.


The primary owner of the account must have a Maine or New Hampshire address.


You may not be or have been an owner of a Camden National Bank consumer checking account during the last twelve (12) months prior to opening this account.


The minimum opening account deposit is $25.


If you set up $500 or more in direct deposits within 60 calendar days of opening your account, a $300 will be direct deposited to your account within 90 calendar days of the qualifying transaction.


Account bonuses are reported to the IRS as interest income.


Account must be open, active and not overdrawn at the time the bonus is made.


Overdrawn includes any utilization of any Progressive Pay amount that may be available to you.


One bonus payment per account or individual.


This cannot be combined with any other offer.


Employees of Camden National Bank or its affiliates are excluded from this offer.


Contact the bank for further details. Limited-time offer, subject to change.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Rewards checking has a $5 monthly fee




$0 if you maintain a $500 minimum average daily balance




Early Account Termination Fee


There is an early account termination fee of $25 if you close the account within 6 months of account opening.


Our Verdict


There was a 
$200 bonus with no direct deposit requirement
 and a 
$300 bonus with a direct deposit requirement but had an account that was harder to keep fee free
. I do think this is worth doing and will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

The Offer

Home Federal Savings Bank is offering a bonus of up to $250. Bonus is broken down as follows:



$200 when you open a new account with a direct deposit of $500+


$25 when you add a debit card to your account


$25 when you enroll in eStatements and online banking










 


The Fine Print




New account owners must not have been a Home Federal checking account client in the last 12 months.


Checking account minimum opening balance is $25.


$100 reward will be credited to the account within 60 days of meeting the direct deposit qualification.


Qualifications must be met by 06/30/19 (direct deposit must clear by 08/31/2019).


CardValet requires the Debit Card be activated.


Clients with existing active online banking will qualify for the $50 reward


Reward will be reported as interest on IRS Form 1099-INT.


A $75 early closing fee will be charged by the bank if the account closes within the first 6 months.


This offer is subject to change and may be withdrawn without notice.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Advantage Checking – None


The advantage checking account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Money Market Account – $25


This account has a $25 monthly fee, this is waived with a $10,000 minimum balance.


Early Account Termination Fee


There is an early account termination fee of $75 if the account is closed within 6 months


Our Verdict


Previous best deal was $200
, requirements are exactly the same but everything has been doubled. We still need to know if this is a soft or hard pull, if it’s a soft pull then I definitely think it’s worth doing. The money market bonus is a bit difficult because you need to keep the $10,000 deposited to avoid the monthly fee/early account termination fee.

Early Account Termination Fee


There is a $10 fee if closed within one year according to the 
fee schedule
.


Our Verdict


Not the strongest offer given it’s only for $100 and must be opened in branch, still might be worth doing for some people. Will add it to our list of the 
best bank bonuses
 due to the fact it’s a soft pull to open.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Pinnacle Financial Partners is offering a checking bonus of up a $200 Mastercard gift card when you complete the following steps:



Open account online or in branch


Make a minimum deposit of $100


Set up a recurring direct deposit of your full payroll (or gov’t benefits) to your new account. One recurring direct deposit must post and clear your account by March 1, 2024




















The Fine Print




Offer expires August 31, 2018.


This offer is for new Pinnacle checking households, or for households that have not had an open Pinnacle consumer checking account for at least 24 months.


Limit one bonus per household. Cannot be combined with other offers.


Must be 18 or older at time of account opening.


Offer is non-transferable.


Account is subject to approval.


To receive the $200 Mastercard® gift card, you must (1) open your account with $100, and (2) have at least one recurring direct deposit post and clear your account before Aug. 31, 2018.


Direct deposit is a recurring electronic deposit and must be your full payroll or government benefits.


The Mastercard gift card will be mailed to you via USPS within 2-4 weeks of meeting the qualified requirements.


Mastercard is a registered trademark of Mastercard International Incorporated.


Please note: there is a monthly inactivity fee of $2.95 after 12 months of inactivity on your Mastercard gift card.


Bonus will be reported as income on IRS Form 1099-INT and is valued at $200 total.




Avoiding Fees


The easiest account to keep fee free is the Grizzlies Basic Checking account, this has a $3 monthly service fee that is waived with eStatements. 
Fee schedule
 says there is no early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


Previously they have offered 
$100 in Grizzlies tickets
 or 
$200 in titans gear
. This deal is much better as the $200 gift card is much more flexible. We need to know whether it’s a soft pull to open and how flexible they are on the direct deposit requirement (e.g do any work arounds work?) before knowing if this is a good deal or not. Maybe it’s possible to fund with a credit card as well? If anybody knows or has any experience with this bank then please share in the comments below. For now I won’t be adding it to the 
best bank bonuses
 due to all the unknowns but it has the potential to be a goood deal.

The Fine Print




An account is not eligible to receive a cash bonus under this offer if 1) the primary account holder currently has an existing personal checking account (Basic Checking, Convenience Checking, Interest Checking, Interest Plus Checking, Military Checking, Minimum Balance Checking, Premier Checking, O2 Checking, Premier Plus Checking, Convenience Plus Checking and Prime Time Checking (“existing personal checking account”) at Old Second National Bank, 2) has had an existing personal checking account open in the 12 months prior to the date of account opening, or 3) the primary account holder has received a personal checking account-related bonus in the twenty-four months prior to the date of account opening.


The bonuses described in this ad are limited per primary account holder, regardless of the number of accounts opened.


The new “personal checking account” (O2 Checking, Premier Plus Checking, Convenience Plus Checking, Military Checking, and Prime Time Checking) must be opened during the promotion period with the code and must have a positive balance on the 90th calendar day from the date the new personal checking account was opened in accordance with the bank’s procedures.


Offers are only available on personal checking accounts and the Money Builder Savings account; business accounts, trusts accounts with EINs, Health Savings Accounts, employee accounts and estate accounts are excluded from this offer.


To receive the first $50 cash bonus, 1) provide the offer code and open a new personal checking account, subject to approval, 2) apply for, be issued, and activate a debit card tied to the personal checking account within 90 calendar days of account opening and 3) enroll in e-Statements within 90 calendar days of account opening.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Money connection account has a $3.95 fee if you opt for paper statements, this is waived with paperless statements enabled.


Early Account Termination Fee


According to this comment
 there is an early account termination fee of $25 if closed within 90 days.


Our Verdict


Previously this was a $200 bonus
, but without the savings requirements. This is an extra $100 but does require a deposit of $5,000. The savings requirement doesn’t seem to bad as you only need a $5,000 balance on the 90th day so no real deposit length requirement. We will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

.


Our Verdict


Seems like an easy bonus to trigger, although keep the account fee free with a direct deposit is a little bit annoying but worse case you can just pay a $5 fee.

$250 paid when new or existing member opens a checking account with a minimum deposit of $25, has at least one direct deposit that totals $100 per month and conducts 6+ debit card transactions within 60 days of checking account opening.


Bonus will be paid within 30 days of minimum requirements being met.

If criteria is not met, $250 bonus will be withdrawn from account.


New members must open account at honorcu.com/jointhefam or a local member center location.


Existing members must open new checking account at member center location and specifically mention the $250 offer at time of opening.

Monthly Fees


Benefit checking has no monthly fees to worry about


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so I’m unsure if any early account termination fee is charged or not.


Our Verdict


Benefit checking account used to earn 5% APY, now it’s sadly only 3%
 so I wouldn’t recommend that considering the 
better high yield savings accounts
 out there. This bonus is OK, but sadly it’s a hard pull to open the account so won’t be worth it for most people. Because of that I won’t be adding this to 
our list of the best checking bonuses

Freedom Credit Union may adjust the deposited bonus or remove the deposited bonus at any time if Freedom Credit Union suspects accounts were opened by fraudulent, suspicious, or illegal means, including but not limited to providing Freedom Credit Union with fraudulent or fabricated information.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


This account has no monthly fees, I was also unable to find an early account termination fee in 
their fee schedule
.


Our Verdict


We don’t know enough about this bonus to really comment at the moment, if somebody signs up and provides more information (e.g hard/soft pull + credit card funding) then I’d recommend using their referral information to complete this bonus as a way of saying thanks. For now we haven’t added it to 
our list of the best bank bonuses

The Offer


Direct link to offer




CIBC is offering a $200 checking bonus when you open a new iCan or MyChoice account in branch when you meet the following requirements:



Open account with a minimum of $500+


Receive at least one direct deposit or ACH automated debit transaction


Elect to receive electronic statements








The Fine Print




Bonus will post within 100 days of account opening if requirements are met


The account must remain open on the payment date to receive the bonus


Only one bonus per person is allowed


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees












Looks like all the checking accounts are now fee free.


Early Account Termination Fee


There is a $25 early account termination fee if the account is closed within 90 days.


Our Verdict


We’ve previously posted another 
CIBC US deal for $300 that could be opened online but was only available to certain employer groupers
. Some people were to sign up anyway and then their accounts were closed but CIBC did send them $150 check for the inconvenience. That’s always a good sign in terms of customer service in my opinion. This one should be open to anybody who can get to a branch, 
even if you live out of state
. Definitely worth doing if you’re in the area as it seems like any ACH will trigger the direct deposit requirement. I’ve added it to the 
best bank bonus
 page.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




KeyBank is offering a bonus of $300 when you open a new eligible checking account and complete the following requirements:



Use offer code 
PDSA1224


Make one direct deposit of $1,000+










The Fine Print




Offer available online only.


You must open a Key Express Checking® account (this is the basic banking account in NY), Key Advantage® checking account, Key Privilege® checking account, or Key Privilege Select Checking® account by the expiration date and make ONE single KeyBank direct deposit of $500 or more within 60 days after account opening to get $200. Normal account service charges and balance requirements apply to these accounts.


Direct deposit transactions are limited to: payroll, Social Security, pension and government benefits. Accounts titled as Trust Accounts, Estate, and No Access are excluded from eligibility. Employees of KeyBank, its affiliates and subsidiaries are not eligible for this offer. Offer/Reservation number is non-transferable, cannot be sold and is required to qualify.


Limit one gift per qualifying account.


Limit one gift per individual.


The value of your gift will be reported on Form 1099-INT and deposited into your account within 60 days of meeting requirements.


If you close your account within 180 days of account opening, you will be charged a $25 account early closure fee.


Other miscellaneous charges may apply.

All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Key Smart Checking No Monthly Fee


This is a new account that can be opened with no monthly fee to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


Looks to be $0 now
.




Our Verdict


Normally there is a $300 deal
, but that is only available in selected states in the fine print. This time there is no location restriction in the fine print, so it’ll be interesting to see what states this bonus is open to. Fingers crossed it’s available nationwide. If that’s the case we will be adding it to the best checking bonuses. It’s worth checking to see if you live in an area that is usually targeted for the $300 deal as well, if so I’d wait for one of those to come along.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Power Financial Credit Union is offering a bonus of $199 when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Use promo code JT


Open with an initial deposit of $500 (and maintain that in the account for at least 90 days) or receive a direct deposit




















 


The Fine Print




Promotion can end at any time.


Must use promo code “JT” when opening membership to qualify for the promotion. Prizes will be awarded upon account meeting qualification criteria. New accounts require opening a checking account with a minimum direct deposit or initial deposit of $500, which must remain in the account for at least 90 days. Checking account must remain open for 90 days.


Membership required; $5 membership deposit. Power Financial Credit Union’s membership consists of those who: live or work in Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach County, Hillsborough, Manatee, Pinellas, Sarasota or St. Lucie counties; employees of FPL/NextEra and Ryder System, Inc.; members and employees of Bonefish & Tarpon Trust; and immediate family of all current members. Restrictions apply.


Cannot be combined with other offers. Incentives will be deposited to member’s Power Financial Credit Union


Account no later than 120 days after account opening.


A 1099 may be issued for the value of the incentive on your behalf as income




Avoiding Fees


As the $100 bonus includes savings accounts you should be able to just open the club saving account and this has no monthly fees. You do need to keep the account open for 90 days to avoid any early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


They have offered a similar bonus in the past
 and my verdict is still the same. If there is no hard pull, this is a great deal. I wouldn’t bother with the bigger bonuses that require a loan, but $100 with no monthly fees or any bonus requirements is still a great deal. If anybody does decide to sign up, please share your experiences in the comments below. Because it looks to be a hard pull I’d just avoid this all together.

Monthly Fees












This account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find any fee schedule, so I’m unsure if there is any early account termination fee or not.


Our Verdict


Seems like most recent datapoints say it’s a hard pull. Should still be worth doing for a lot of readers as hard pulls aren’t as important anymore with all the restrictions on churning credit card bonuses. We will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

Direct link to offer




CommunityAmerica Credit Union is offering a $300 bonus when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements within 90 days of account opening:



enroll in CommunityAmerica online banking or the CommunityAmerica Mobile App


complete two or more direct deposits that total at least $2,500










The Fine Print




To receive the $300 credit for a new checking account, you must meet CommunityAmerica Credit Union membership eligibility requirements and (1) Open a new Cashback Free Checking or Chiefs Checking account, which is subject to credit approval, through 11/30/2024 (members with existing Cashback Free Checking or Chiefs Checking accounts or with Cashback Free Checking or Chiefs Checking accounts that have closed within the past six months do not qualify), and within 90 days of account opening, (2) enroll in CommunityAmerica online banking or the CommunityAmerica Mobile App, and (3) complete two or more direct deposits that total at least $2,500.


The direct deposits need to be electronic deposits of your paycheck, pension or government benefits from your employer or the government.


Person to person payments (such as Zelle) are not considered direct deposits.


Within 30 days of meeting qualification requirements, your $300 credit will be posted into the primary account owner’s membership savings account.


The account must be open and in good standing at the time of payout to qualify for the credit.


Examples of ineligible accounts may include: delinquent accounts, accounts that have caused the credit union to experience a loss, accounts in which we suspect illegal activity, fraud, scam or financial exploitation, or accounts involved in legal or administrative proceedings.


Limit one $300 credit per account and per member.


Offer subject to change without notice and cannot be combined with any other offer.


The credit may be reported as income on IRS Form 1099-MISC.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Free checking has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


I don’t see any early account termination fee mentioned.


Our Verdict


Better than the previous $200 bonus that was offered
. Main downside for this bonus is the hard pull, but given how it’s difficult to get too many credit cards now I don’t think number of hard pulls matters as much anymore for most people. We will add this to our list of the 
best bank account bonuses
.

The Fine Print




Offer extended February 15, 2019 thru April 29, 2019.


This offer may be modified or cancelled at any time.


To receive the $250 opening bonus: Open a new eligible FirstBank consumer checking account (eligible accounts are highlighted at FirstBankOnline.com/250Bonus).


Keep the account in good standing for 60 days.


Have a single monthly ACH direct deposit of at least $300 after 60 days of account opening date.


Complete all requirements on or before October 31, 2019.


Customers with an existing FirstBank checking account are not eligible for this bonus offer.


You must not have closed a FirstBank checking account within 180 days of the offer start date (February 15, 2019).


Limit one (1) bonus per customer.


Enrollment and participation in this promotion does not automatically guarantee eligibility.


Bonus Processing: After meeting the bonus qualification requirements, the $250 account opening bonus will be credited to the new FirstBank checking account up to eight (8) weeks after all qualifications are met.


The $250 bonus will appear on the monthly checking account statement when the bonus is credited to the account holder’s checking account.


The bonus is limited to one (1) per customer.


If a bonus is earned it will be reported to the IRS as interest, in the year received, as required by applicable law and will be reported on IRS form 1099-MISC for the year received. Customer is responsible for any applicable taxes and consulting a tax advisor.


For additional fees, see our FirstBank Consumer Schedule of Fees. This offer is non-transferable and may not be combined with any other offers.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Essential checking account has no monthly fees to worry about as long as you opt for paperless statements.


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find any mention of an early account termination fee in the 
fee schedule
.


Our Verdict


Seems like a good deal considering it’s a soft pull and there are no monthly fees to worry about. It’s annoying that you need to live near a branch to have the option to open a checking account but this deal is still worth doing if you’re eligible. I’ll add this to 
our best checking bonus page
.  If anybody has any specific experience with this bank then please share your experiences in the comments.

Make direct deposits of at least $2,500 within 60 days of account opening and receive a bonus of $100






Open a new savings or money market account and make deposits totaling $10,000 within 60 days of checking account opening and maintain a balance of at least $10,000 for three months






The Fine Print




Location where offered: Offer available 7/1/2019-8/31/2019 only to residents of MA, NH, and RI.


Registration: Account holders must open and fund their account AND register for the bonus by 8/31/19 at harborone.com/register in order to be eligible.


Criteria for New Customers: New customer to the Bank; Existing customer that did not have a checking account; Existing customer that is not the tax owner on any existing checking account; Considered new if the customer has not had a checking account in prior 12 months; If multiple accounts are opened with the same signer, only one account will be eligible for the incentive.


To receive the $100 Checking bonus: 1) Open any new eligible HarborOne Personal Checking Account; 2) Receive direct deposits totaling at least $2,500 to this account within 60 days of account opening. Qualifying direct deposits are recurring electronic deposits of your paycheck, pension or government benefits such as social security from your Employer or the Government. Direct Deposits that do not qualify include: deposits to your account made by an individual using online banking or internet payment provided, Person–to–Person and bank transfers between your existing HarborOne Bank accounts or accounts you have at other financial institutions or brokerages.


To receive the $100 Savings bonus: Open any new eligible HarborOne Personal Savings or Money Market account in accordance with the minimum opening balance requirement and make deposits totaling $500.00 within the first 60 days of the Checking Account Opening. (Must also complete checking bonus requirements to be eligible for the additional $100.00)


Bonus Conditions: Account must remain open, active, in good standing, and in the same product type through the 60 day period from account opening to receive the bonus for noted offers above. Once the offer criteria is met, the bonus will be credited into the new personal checking or savings account no later than 80 days from account opening.


Bonus offers do not apply to those customers who have been paid a promotional premium in the past 24 months.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


You can open the Free Plus Checking account and still qualify for this bonus, this account has no monthly fee. CheckIt Savings also has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find any early account termination fee in the 
fee schedule
.


Our Verdict


Previously they offered a bonus of up to $500
, the requirements for the full $500 bonus were much more difficult to meet but still do-able for a lot of people. There was also a comparable offer for $300 that required $5,000 in direct deposits. That was last offered in 2018, so I’m not confident a similar big bonus will come back. Because of that I will add this to our list of the 
best checking account bonuses
.

The Offer

Newtown Savings Bank is offering a bonus of $150 when you open a free checking account and complete the following requirements:



Use the promo code

Use the promo code

You can also get a $50 bonus when you open a statement savings account with a $300 balance or get a $150 bonus when you open a Basic Money Market Savings Account(opens in a new window) with a balance of $20,000






 


The Fine Print




Offer is available for Free Checking Accounts opened by September 29, 2018.


Offer amount will be deposited into the respective checking account 60 days after account opening as long as the direct deposit has been made.


Maximum $150 per household.


Personal checking accounts have a minimum deposit of $25 to open.


Other fees may apply such as paper statement and inactivity fees.


To be eligible for this offer, all account holders must be new checking account customers.


If your checking account is closed within 90 days of opening, the bonus amount will be deducted at closing.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


The free checking account has no monthly fees to worry about. The flagship checking account has a monthly fee that is waived with minimum balance of $2,500.


Early Account Termination Fee


Account needs to be kept open for 90 days, otherwise the bonus will be deducted at time of closing


Our Verdict


Previous bonuses have been for $100 with $150 available in branch only
. Looks like this one can be opened online. 
 (update: unfortunately limit is now only $25). Definitely worth considering if not doing if you’re eligible. I will be adding this to the 
list of the best checking account bonuses
.

The Offer












Direct link to offer






Star Financial Bank is offering a bonus of $300 when you complete the following:






Open a new checking account with promo code STAR300


Monthly direct deposit of $500 or more


Sign up and receive e-statements


Make five (5) debit card transactions monthly










 


The Fine Print




Bonus/Account Information: New checking customers only.


$50 minimum deposit to open a checking account.


Account must remain open and in good standing for 120 days


Bonus will be deposited to the account at the end of 120 days if the following conditions are met: monthly direct deposit of at least $500, e-statements, and at least five (5) debit card transactions.


Consumer accounts only. Employees of STAR Financial Bank are not eligible.


Only one offer per household.


Offer is non-transferable.


Expires 9/30/18.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


E-Checking account has no monthly fees to worry about. You do need to keep the account open for 120 days to receive the bonus.


Our Verdict


It’s annoying that you need to meet the requirements each month to be eligible for the bonus, there is also some non transferable language in the fine print but I don’t think that means it’s targeted. If anybody signs up for this bonus then please share your experiences in the comments below. I will add it to the 
best checking bonus page,
 even though they had the online offer previously it seems like the bonus only comes around once a year so probably not worth waiting.

To receive the $50 bonus, you must complete 20 point-of-sale transactions post to your account by 5/31/25 and the card and account must remain open through 9/30/25.


Earn up to two special one-time bonuses totaling $75 that The Summit will deposit into your RoundUp Savings when your RoundUp Savings account reaches a balance of $250 ($25 bonus) and $500 ($50 bonus).




















The Fine Print




Offer limited to members that have not had a debit card in the past 12 months. Limited to 2 cardholders per account (up to $300 maximum with Premium Checking or $150 maximum with Enhanced Checking).


To receive the $150 bonus with Premium Checking or $75 with Enhanced Checking, you must order a new debit card between 2/4/19 and 3/31/19, have 20 point-of-sale transactions post to your account by 5/31/19 and the card and account must remain open through 9/30/19.

Offer subject to change at any time at our sole discretion without notice.


The Account Maintenance Fee is waived if you meet certain conditions. See branch for details.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Premium checking account (required for the $150 bonus) has a $5 monthly fee. This is waived if you have a daily balance of $1,000 or more.


Early Account Termination Fee


Account must remain open through 9/30/19, otherwise it looks like the bonus will be forfeit.


Our Verdict


Seems like an amazing offer, especially if you can do it twice per account for a total bonus of $300. It’s not clear if you’ll be able to open via phone/online or if you eventually need to go in branch. Definitely worth doing if it’s a soft pull, if anybody goes for this bonus then please share your experiences in the comments below.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Sharepoint Credit Union is offering a bonus of $150 when you open a new checking account. Premier Rate Account also earns 5% APY on balances up to $5,000 for the 
 first year. There are no requirements for the bonus or 5% APY rate. To receive the $150 bonus you need to deposit at least $200 at account opening and receive at least $300 in direct deposits per month and complete 10 debit card transactions.
















The Fine Print




APY up to 5.00%, but will vary based on checking account option.


All accounts are subject to approval.


Restrictions apply.


SharePoint will match up to $150 with the first deposit.


Funds will be deposited into qualified member’s Checking or Savings account at account opening.


Funds will be held until a minimum of $300 has been received via direct deposit.


Direct deposit of $300 per month is required.


SharePoint reserves the right to reclaim funds if the account is closed within six months.


Member is responsible for any related taxes or restrictions according to MN laws.


Cannot be combined with other offers.


Promotion is limited to (1) $150 incentive per member, with no prior checking relationship in the last six months.


Offer ends 9/30/2019.


Federally insured by the NCUA.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Premier Rate Account comes with a $5.95 monthly fee, this is waived if you have 10 or more point of sale transactions. They also have a free checking account.


Early Account Termination Fee


Bonus is forfeit if the account is closed within six months of account opening


Our Verdict


Not really worth considering due to the hard pull. Previously they had a $100 bonus with the 5% APY with no requirements, now it’s $50 more but it requires a direct deposit. I won’t be adding this to 
our best bank account bonuses
.

Orange County’s Credit Union is offering a referral bonus of $100 to both parties. To receive the bonus the person being referred must:



Opt for eStatements


Have either Direct Deposit or 5 Debit Card purchases




















The Fine Print




All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


They offer a better than free checking account with no monthly minimums or fees. Unfortunately the better than free checking account has to be opened in branch, if you open online your best bet is the basic checking account this has a $6 fee that is waived with a balance of $750+.


Early Account Termination Fee


You do need to keep the account open for 90 days, otherwise the bonus will be forfeit.


Our Verdict


Feel free to share your referral information in the comments below. Relatively easy bonus to meet the requirements for and it’s a soft pull. Because of that I’ve added it to 
our list of the best bank bonuses
.

, but no direct deposit required this time and open to more areas.

Have at least one qualifying direct deposit of $500 or more for 3 consecutive months.










The Fine Print




Cash offer is not available to existing FirstBank consumer checking customers or those whose accounts have been closed within 90 days or closed with a negative balance.


Past customers who ever received a gift from FirstBank are ineligible for this offer.


Offer valid for new personal checking accounts opened between April 28, 2018 to June 24, 2018.


The account must be opened online at efirstbank.com/offers or bring in this advertisement to any FirstBank location to receive the $300 offer.


Limit one gift per household, per lifetime.


Limit one gift per account.


The cash offer will be given if the account opened is in good standing, and the customer enrolls for online banking, and one direct deposit greater than $500 posts to the new checking account.


Direct deposit must be new to FirstBank and must be payroll, pension, Social Security or other recurring government benefits.


Direct deposit cannot be multiple direct deposits combined that exceed $500.


Requirements must be met within 60 days of account opening and the cash offer will be deposited into the new checking account within 90 days of account opening.


We reserve the right to substitute gifts offered at any time with an item of similar value. Limited time offer.


The $300 cash offer is considered interest and is subject to IRS and other tax reporting.


The cash offer is considered a bonus that can be revoked if the account is closed within six months of opening.


FirstBank employees are not eligible to receive the offer.


Online Banking plus direct deposit or Visa Debit Card purchases required.

Avoiding Fees


This account has a $12 monthly fee. Waived if you do any of the following:




Maintain a daily $1,500 minimum balance.


Maintain $5,000 in combined average monthly balance across your FirstBank personal accounts.


Receive $500 per statement cycle in qualifying ACH direct deposits.




Early Account Termination Fee


If the account is closed within 12 months the bonus can be revoked


Our Verdict


Deal isn’t as good as it previously was as you now need a direct deposit.  Because of the reports of it being a hard pull, I don’t think it is worth doing but that depends on how much hard pulls matter to you.  Because of that we will not be adding this to 
our list of the best checking accounts
.

Seems like a fantastic account to open even before the $200 bonus due to the huge credit card funding allowed. Because of this I will be adding this to 
our list of the best checking account bonuses

Relatively small bonus but it’s a soft pull and you can fund with a credit card so I think it’s worth doing if you’ve already done the bigger bonuses available to you. I’ll add this to 
our list of the best checking account bonuses

Savings Bank of Danbury is offering a bonus of up to $300 when you open a new checking account with promo code Get123. Bonuses are as follows:



To qualify for the $100 cash bonus, you are required to open a new Priority Checking account and make 10 debit card transactions per month for two (2) consecutive months


To qualify for the $200 cash bonus you are required to open a new Priority Plus Checking account and have qualifying direct deposit(s) totaling $500 per month for two (2) consecutive months


To qualify for the $300 cash bonus you are required to open a new Priority Platinum Checking account and have qualifying direct deposit(s) totaling $500 per month for two (2) consecutive months










The Fine Print




Minimum $50 to open a checking account.


This offer applies to new checking account customers.


New money is defined as money not currently on deposit with Savings Bank of Danbury.


New checking account customer is defined as anyone not having owned a checking account with Savings Bank of Danbury in the 180 days prior to taking advantage of this offer.


This offer is limited to one checking account per tax ID#.


Account must be opened and maintained in good standing for a period of 90 days from the opening date, (the introductory period) to qualify for each bonus.


An account is considered to be in “Good Standing” if the balance remains positive and no overdrafts are incurred.


To qualify for the $100 cash bonus, you are required to open a new Priority Checking account and make 10 debit card transactions per month for two (2) consecutive months.


To qualify for the $200 cash bonus you are required to open a new Priority Plus Checking account and have qualifying direct deposit(s) totaling $500 per month for two (2) consecutive months.


To qualify for the $300 cash bonus you are required to open a new Priority Platinum Checking account and have qualifying direct deposit(s) totaling $500 per month for two (2) consecutive months.


Qualifying direct deposits are regular, periodic automated clearing house (ACH) credits, which may include payroll, salary, pension or government payments (such as Social Security).


Transfers from another Savings Bank of Danbury deposit account do not qualify.


The maximum amount any customer can receive is $300.


Bonuses will be paid in the statement cycle following the first 90 days after qualifications have been met.


Promotion compensation is considered taxable income and an IRS-1099 form will be issued.


This offer is subject to change and to early termination without prior notice at any time.


Other fees and restrictions may apply. Savings Bank of Danbury employees and their immediate families are not eligible for this offer.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees




Priority Checking ($100 bonus). This account has no monthly fees


Priority Plus Checking ($200 bonus). This account has a $12 monthly fee that is waived with a $1,000 balance.


Priority Platinum Checking ($300 bonus). This account has a $20 monthly fee that is waived with a $2,000 balance.




Early Account Termination Fee












I wasn’t able to find any mention of any early account termination fee in the fee schedule.


Our Verdict


I think you either do the $100 bonus (to avoid the direct deposit requirement) or the $300 bonus as the $200 bonus seems a bit pointless (only advantage is it’s slightly easier to keep fee free). Last time we saw a bonus it was only for $150 so if you live in an eligible area I do think this one is worth doing and will add it to the 
best bank bonuses

Provident Credit Union is offering a bonus of $300 when you open a new checking account with promo code 
 3030 and complete the requirements below.




To earn the $300 New Account Bonus, simply do these three things 
for two months
, starting the month following your account opening:




Make purchases of $400 or more using a Provident debit and/or credit card


Have direct deposits or automatic credits of at least $500


Enroll in online banking and e-Documents with valid e-mail address
















The Fine Print




Offer expires February 29, 2020.


APY (Annual Percentage Yield) as of January 1, 2020 and is subject to change. To receive 
 1.01% APY on balances up to $25,000, 0.08% APY on balances beyond the first $25,000, and ATM rebates, three requirements must be met: (i) Make purchases of $300 or more using a Provident debit and/or credit card** per month, (ii) Have a monthly direct deposit or ACH transfer (automatic debit or credit) post to the account, (iii) Maintain enrollment in e-Documents. If the 3 requirements are not met in their entirety, the APY will be 0% and no ATM rebates will be issued for that month.


IMPORTANT: All qualifying purchases and transactions referred to as “per month” or “monthly” only count towards the requirement of the month in which they POST, which will be on a business day (Monday – Friday) and may take one or more business days from the purchase/transaction date.


Automatic or electronic payments using your checking account and routing number are not considered purchases. By providing your payee with your debit or credit card number, your posted automatic payments will be counted as eligible purchases. Debit card cash-back amounts, cash advances on credit cards, and checks do not count towards qualifications. Only one Visa credit card can have its purchases count towards your qualifications each month (whichever one that is selected on the account on the last business day of the month). If you have more than one Super Reward Checking account, credit card purchases on one credit card cannot meet the requirements of more than one checking account.


$300 Checking Bonus: You must be a new Provident Credit Union member, 18 or older and reside in California. You are not eligible if you are a current owner or signer on a Provident Credit Union personal or business account 
or if you have been an owner or signer on a Provident Credit Union personal or business account within the last two years. 


One New Account Bonus per household/business.


To be eligible, you must open one of the following checking accounts: Super Reward Checking, Provident Checking or Simply Free Checking; all other checking accounts are not eligible for the bonus.


New Account Bonus offer may expire anytime.


The minimum balance for the Membership Savings account is $5.00.


You must fund your Checking account within the first 60 days of account opening with a minimum deposit of $25. If you fail to fund your Checking account within the first 60 days you are no longer eligible for the New Account Bonus and your account(s) will be closed.


In order to qualify for your New Account Bonus your account must be active and in good standing for two consecutive months following the month that your account is opened. All qualifying purchases and transactions referred to as “per month” or “monthly” only count towards the requirement of the month in which they POST, which will be on a business day (Monday – Friday) and may take one or more business days from the purchase/transaction date.


Your account is deemed active by: (1) making purchases of $300 or more using a debit and/or credit card2 per month, AND (2) performing monthly direct deposits or automatic credits of at least $500 into your checking account, AND (3) enrolling in Provident’s online banking service and e-Documents with valid e-mail address. If your account remains inactive after 90 days from account opening you are no longer eligible for the New Account Bonus.

Your account is in good standing if you: (1) demonstrate responsible account management—such as making regular deposits to bring your account to a positive end of day balance at least once every 30 days (including the payment of all credit union fees and charges); (2) avoid excessive overdrafts suggesting the use of Courtesy Pay as a continuing line of credit; (3) there are no legal orders, levies or liens against your account.


New Account Bonus: We generally pay the New Account Bonus by crediting your Provident Credit Union Checking account. If Provident funded your savings account at account opening, you will receive the difference between your initial $5.00 Savings account bonus and the stated bonus within 120 days of account opening.


We may report the value of the New Account Bonus to the IRS and any applicable taxes are the responsibility of the member.




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


Your best option is to open the Super Reward Checking account which has no monthly fees or minimum balance requirements and also earns the high APY  rate when requirements are met.


Membership Enrollment $10


If you enroll with provident then you must pay a $10 membership enrollment fee. Although apparently it’s possible to get this waived if you apply online.


Early Account Termination Fee


None of the Provident checking accounts come with an early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


The 
bank’s most recent offer was for $300 when you maintain $10,000 deposit.
 This offer has a spend and direct deposit requirement for two months, but no money tied up. It does come with a hard pull if you are sensitive to those. Looks overall like a pretty good deal if you can meet the requirements.
 Some are saying
 you can even stack a
 $100 referral bonus on top of this. I’ll add this to the 
list of the best bank account bonuses
.

Direct link to offer




Open a new Sacramento Credit Union free checking account and receive a bonus of $200 when you receive a direct deposit within 60 days of account opening.














 


The Fine Print




Existing Sacramento Credit Union checking account holders are ineligible for the $200 bonus. Direct Deposit (electronic transfer for payroll, pension or government benefits) must post to new checking account by day 60 after account opening.


A $200 bonus will be deposited into the new free checking account on the first business day after 60 days of the account opening.


Bonus is considered interest and will be reported on IRS form 1099-INT.


Offer valid through December 31, 2024.




Avoiding Fees


You need to pay a $5 fee to join
.


Monthly Fees


The free checking account required has no monthly fees to worry about


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so I’m unsure if there is any early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


Not a huge bonus, but better than the 
previous $100 deal they have had
. The small amount of credit card funding and the fact that there is no monthly fees to worry about is nice. I’ll be adding this to 
our list of the best checking account bonuses
.

Jovia Financial Credit Union is offering a bonus of $150 when you open a new checking account and receive a direct deposit of $100+

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule, so I’m unsure if there is any early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


Looks like it’s worth doing considering it’s a soft pull to open and there are no monthly fees to worry about.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


There is no monthly fee to worry about


Early Account Termination Fee


Account must be kept open for six months otherwise bonus is forfeit.


Our Verdict


Advertised as a $750 bonus but most of it is from closing costs on a mortgage and from opening a credit card. We’ve talked about 
Lafayette FCU because of the $600 credit card bonus they offer
. Worth doing if you’ve done the bigger bonuses in the past.

The Offer


Direct link to offer




Power Financial Credit Union is offering a bonus of $199 when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Use promo code JT


Open with an initial deposit of $500 (and maintain that in the account for at least 90 days) or receive a direct deposit




















 


The Fine Print




Promotion can end at any time.


Must use promo code “JT” when opening membership to qualify for the promotion. Prizes will be awarded upon account meeting qualification criteria. New accounts require opening a checking account with a minimum direct deposit or initial deposit of $500, which must remain in the account for at least 90 days. Checking account must remain open for 90 days.


Membership required; $5 membership deposit. Power Financial Credit Union’s membership consists of those who: live or work in Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach County, Hillsborough, Manatee, Pinellas, Sarasota or St. Lucie counties; employees of FPL/NextEra and Ryder System, Inc.; members and employees of Bonefish & Tarpon Trust; and immediate family of all current members. Restrictions apply.


Cannot be combined with other offers. Incentives will be deposited to member’s Power Financial Credit Union


Account no later than 120 days after account opening.


A 1099 may be issued for the value of the incentive on your behalf as income




Avoiding Fees


As the $100 bonus includes savings accounts you should be able to just open the club saving account and this has no monthly fees. You do need to keep the account open for 90 days to avoid any early account termination fee.


Our Verdict


They have offered a similar bonus in the past
 and my verdict is still the same. If there is no hard pull, this is a great deal. I wouldn’t bother with the bigger bonuses that require a loan, but $100 with no monthly fees or any bonus requirements is still a great deal. If anybody does decide to sign up, please share your experiences in the comments below. Because it looks to be a hard pull I’d just avoid this all together.

The Offer












Direct link to offer




Andrews Federal Credit Union is offering a bonus of $150 when you open a new Kasasa Cash, Kasasa Cash Back, Forces, or Online Checking and complete the following requirements:



Use promo code ANDREWS


Make a direct deposit of $500+ and maintain that for 90 days










The Fine Print




To receive the $150 bonus, you must (1) establish a new membership with Andrews Federal Credit Union; (2) open a new Kasasa Cash, Kasasa Cash Back, Forces, or Online Checking; (3) start a new direct deposit of $500 or more to your new checking account within sixty (60) calendar days of opening the account; and (4) maintain that direct deposit for at least ninety (90) calendar days (i.e. ninety (90) calendar days from the date of the first direct deposit to the account).


Membership and checking account must be opened during the promotional period of 11/15/2023 and 12/31/2023.


You must meet the terms of your new checking account type, including the direct deposit requirement, in order to be eligible for the $150 bonus.


Qualifying direct deposits include recurring electronic deposits of payroll, pension, or Social Security. Person-to-person, bank transfers or other electronic money transfers, such as those made through internet payment services, do not qualify. No minimum balance required to open a new Kasasa Cash, Kasasa Cash Back, Forces, or Online Checking account; the minimum balance to maintain each checking account type may vary, visit the individual product pages linked above for full account details.


The $150 will be credited to the new checking account after you have met the 90 day direct deposit requirement, if all other checking account requirements are also met.


Existing primary Andrews Federal members (i.e. memberships opened prior to 11/15/2023) are not eligible for this offer.


Previous memberships that were closed within 180 days prior to promo are not eligible for this offer.


Your new Andrews Federal checking account must still be open and in good standing when we seek to credit the bonus, otherwise the bonus is forfeited.


Only one bonus will be awarded per member regardless of the number of accounts opened.


Bonus offers are not transferable and are reportable for tax purposes.


A $25 early account closing fee applies if the account is closed within 60 days of opening.


All Andrews Federal checking and savings accounts are subject to Andrews Federal standard account agreements.


Offer is subject to change at any time.


Employees, Directors or contractors of the Credit Union, or their direct family members are not eligible for this offer.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


These accounts have no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


A $25 early account closing fee applies if the account is closed within 60 days of opening


Our Verdict


Previously this was $200
 with the same requirements. Still worth doing and the Kasasa Cash checking account earns 6% APY on up to $25,000. We will add this to our list of 
best bank account bonuses
.

Mainstreet Credit Union is offering a bonus of $300 when you open a new checking account when you complete the following requirements within the first 90 days of account opening:



Have two direct deposits through ACH or RTP including Payroll, Pension, or Government benefits posted with a cumulative total of $400 or more within 90 days of account opening


Be enrolled in eStatements


Make at least 10 debit card transactions








 


The Fine Print




Limited time offer.


To receive the $150, you must open a new Mainstreet Credit Union checking account.


Minimum deposit may be required.


Existing checking accounts do not qualify for this offer, and members are limited to one new checking account per membership.


The $150 incentive will be deposited into your share savings account as an extraordinary dividend for tax purposes after 90 days, provided your account is in good standing.


To receive the $150, you must also have a recurring direct deposit of at least $200 posted to the account each month (such as a paycheck, pension payment, Social Security payment, or any other government payment), participate in eStatements, and complete 10 debit card transactions within the first 90 days of account opening.


Debit transactions exclude credits/refunds and ATM transactions.


Offer valid on new checking accounts opened through August 31, 2018.


For the purpose of this promotion, a “month” is defined as 30 days and a “new checking account” is one that is opened under a membership number that has had no prior Mainstreet checking relationship.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them

Monthly Fees


This account has no monthly fees to worry about

Our Verdict


They offered the $150 checking bonus last year
, not worth considering due to the fact it’s a hard pull. Because of that simple fact we won’t be adding it to the list of the 
best checking bonuses
.

Direct link to offer




Greater Nevada Credit Union is offering a bonus of $100 when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Receive at least one direct deposit within 90 days of account opening










The Fine Print




The following conditions apply to Greater Perks benefits: Membership/ownership with Greater Nevada Credit Union (GNCU) is open to anyone living or working in any of Nevada’s 17 counties, and members of their immediate family.


Offers may not be combined with any other special offers or promotions.


To qualify for the $100 bonus deposit for new checking accounts, all accounts must be in good standing and one direct deposit must post and clear within 90 days of opening an account.


Bonus will be credited to your checking account within 30 days after the initial 90-day period has passed and all qualifications have been met.


Free Student Checking accounts are not eligible for bonus.


One direct deposit requirement is waived only for students of the University of Nevada, Reno; Western Nevada College; and Great Basin College.


To qualify for the $25 bonus deposit for new I Can Save accounts, all accounts must be in good standing and the bonus will be deposited into the member’s Regular Share Savings account within 30 days of opening an account.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


They offer an Aspire checking account with a $15 monthly avoidable fee, but it also offers 4% APY on balances up to $50,000. They also offer a connect checking account, this has a $4 monthly fee that is waived with 6 debit card purchases or if you’re 65+ years of age.


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so I’m unsure if there is any early account termination fee or not.


Our Verdict


A lot of people will already have the Aspire checking account
, so I assume that will make them ineligible. Even if you don’t it might make sense to just open that account online without the bonus so you can do the credit card funding. Because of that, unless you can fund with a credit card in branch and it’s a purchase I won’t be adding this to our list of the 
best checking bonuses
.

The Offer












Direct link to offer




Heritage Credit Union is offering a $100 bonus when you open a new simply free checking account with promo code 100CHECKWEB and receive a direct deposit of $100 within 30 days of account opening






 


The Fine Print




All offers subject to qualified credit.


New members: subject to member eligibility and an initial deposit of $25 into a primary savings account, which must remain open for 12 months. Coupon must be presented by September 30, 2016, and prior to opening the account.


Qualifying accounts must be opened within 30 days after presenting coupon.


Cannot use multiple offers on same product.


Promotions can change or end at any time.


Each coupon may be used once per individual member account.

Heritage employees and their immediate families are not eligible. Void if expired, altered, reproduced or photocopied. Must not have had an open Heritage checking account in the 6 months prior to opening new account.

Direct deposit must be received within 30 days of opening new checking account and cannot be transferred from another Heritage account.


Federally insured by NCUA. Equal Housing Opportunity Lender.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


The best account to open would be the free checking account with no monthly fees. I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so I’m unsure if any early account termination fee is charged or not.


Our Verdict


Not a huge bonus, but worth doing if you’ve already done the bigger bonuses available in your area. Sometimes this can only be opened in branch, but this time it can be opened online so we will add it to the 
best bank account bonuses
.

Early Account Termination Fee


I couldn’t find any mention of an early account termination fee in the

Relatively small bonus but it’s a soft pull and you can fund with a credit card so I think it’s worth doing if you’ve already done the bigger bonuses available to you. I’ll add this to

Cannot be combined with any other new member offers.


Members who have received previous new member/direct deposit promotions in the past 12 months do not qualify.


Business accounts are excluded from offer.


Membership eligibility required.


Must first set up Checking/Qualified Direct Deposit to be eligible for the remaining incentive money.


1Members who open a Checking Account and Qualified Direct Deposit will receive a $100 deposit to their Checking Account.


If account is closed within first 6 months, promotional deposit will be deducted from account. Qualified Direct Deposit is a recurring direct deposit of a paycheck, pension, Social Security or other periodic income payment of at least $500 into a Savings or Checking Account on a month-to-month basis made by an outside organization or agency.

Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


There is no monthly fee to worry about


Early Account Termination Fee


Account must be kept open for six months otherwise bonus is forfeit.


Our Verdict


Advertised as a $750 bonus but most of it is from closing costs on a mortgage and from opening a credit card. We’ve talked about 
Lafayette FCU because of the $600 credit card bonus they offer
. Worth doing if you’ve done the bigger bonuses in the past.

Western State Bank is offering a bonus of $100 when you open a new VIP or VIP Plus personal checking account and complete the following requirements:



Sign up for direct deposit


Enroll in eStatements


Open a Cash & Check Card








The Fine Print




Valid on new personal checking accounts only. The following criteria must be met to receive $100: Open a VIP or VIP Plus personal checking account, enroll in direct deposit, enroll in eStatements, open a Cash & Check Card.


Reward will be credited to your new checking account within 60 days after direct deposit is received assuming account is open.


Limit one offer per person


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


VIP Checking $10 Monthly Fee












It’s possible to avoid this monthly fee if you have a minimum balance of $500 or maintain $5,000 balance in Loans + Deposits


VIP Checking Plus $10 Monthly Fee


This account requires you to have a combined balance of $10,000 in deposit accounts or maintain $25,000 in Loan & Deposit balances


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so I’m unsure if there is any early account termination fee or not.


Our Verdict


They did offer a $200 bonus before
, that had more requirements but was still better than this bonus. 
Western State Bank has been getting more attention recently due to the 2.5% APY nationwide account they offer
, but this deal will only be available in branch in AZ & ND unfortunately. Because the $200 bonus was from way back in 2014 I don’t think we will see a better bonus than this in at least the short to medium term so I’ll add this towards the bottom of the 
best checking bonuses
.

Monthly Fees












Wise checking has no monthly fees to worry about.


Early Account Termination Fee


Account needs to be kept open for six months otherwise the bonus of $100 is forfeit.


Our Verdict


Worth doing if you live near a branch, just keep in mind they are somewhat Chexsystems sensitive so if you’ve opened more than 7-8 accounts in the last 12 months I’d give this one a miss. I will still add this to our 
best bank account bonus page

The Fine Print




Bonus: Limited time offer. To earn the $200 direct deposit bonus, you must establish a qualified recurring direct deposit of $200 or more into the account.


The bonus will be deposited into the new account 91 days after account opening.


Limitations: The bonus cannot be used as the opening deposit.


Offer not available to existing checking account customers, those with fiduciary accounts or those whose account has been closed.


Limit 1 bonus per household.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


They offer a simply free checking account with no monthly fees to worry about. There is an early account termination fee of $25 if you close the account within 180 days.


Our Verdict


I generally don’t recommend $100 bonuses that must be opened in branch, but might be worth it for some if they live near a branch. Purely because it’s usually a lot of work for a $100 bonus that is also taxed. Because of this I won’t be adding it to 
our best bank bonus page

Monthly Fees


$7 monthly fee is waived if you do any of the following:




Perform 20+ card transactions (Debit and/or credit)


Members who are age 24 and younger,


age 60 and older, or


maintain an average daily balance of $10,000 in MyStyle Checking will also have the fee waived automatically.




Early Account Termination Fee












Account previously needed to be kept open for six months, but doesn’t seem like that is the case any longer.


Our Verdict


Seems like you can open out of state with a donation to American Consumer Council
. 
Previous bonus was $150
. Not the biggest bonus but might be worth doing for those that have already done the larger bonuses.

The Fine Print




*To qualify for the $100 checking bonus: You must be a new Anna Neighborhood CU consumer checking customer who has not had a Neighborhood CU consumer checking account open within the last 6 months. Promo code Anna must be used at application input to be eligible for this bonus. Eligible accounts include Neighborhood CU’s Kasasa Cash Checking, Kasasa Cash Back Checking, Choice Checking and Fresh Start.


Within sixty (60) days of account opening, must have one (1) electronic Direct Deposit of your paycheck, pension or government benefits (such as Social Security) from your employer or the government in the amount of at least $500 post to the new checking account. Qualifying electronic Direct Deposits do not include payments received into your account from payment apps such as Paypal, Venmo and other similar payment service providers.


Offer cannot be combined with other offers. We reserve the right to deduct the bonus amount if the account is closed within 12 months of opening.

Neighborhood CU may report the value of the bonus to the IRS as required by law.

Monthly Fees


These accounts have no monthly fees to worry about

Our Verdict


We have covered the 2.52% APY account that Neighborhood Credit Union offers before as well
. This $100 bonus isn’t really worth doing due to the hard pull unfortunately.

I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so I’m unsure if they charge an early account termination fee or not.

People have had issues with TTCU in the past, but if you can get approved and get the bonus then this looks easy to complete the requirements for and worth doing.

Direct link to offer




Bank of Texas is offering a $400/$800 bonus when you open a new checking account and complete the following requirements:



Use promo code TEXOFR


$800 with Premier Checking account. Qualify for the bonus by having an aggregate of at least $1,500 in ACH deposits within the first 90 days of account opening, and maintaining a monthly average balance of $10,000 or higher


$400 with Access Checking. Qualify for the bonus by having an aggregate of at least $1,500 in ACH deposits within the first 90 days of opening your Access Checking account.










The Fine Print




All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees












Premier checking has a $25 monthly fee. For each statement cycle that one of the following requirements of average daily balances are met, you’ll avoid the $25 monthly service fee:




$25,000 or more in linked bank deposit accounts (checking, savings, CDs, FDIC-insured IRAs)


or $50,000 or more in any combination of qualifying linked banking, brokerage (available through BOK Financial Advisors – excluding 529s and managed trusts) and 10% credit balances (mortgage, HELOC, PLOC, auto loan & personal loan – excludes small business loans). Accounts are not automatically linked. Please notify your banker which accounts should be linked.




Early Account Termination Fee


Wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so unsure if there is any EATF.


Our Verdict


Don’t think the $800 bonus is worth doing as it’s difficult to keep the account fee free and trigger the bonus. $400 bonus may be worth it. It’s also unclear how strict the location restriction is as well.

You must use the promo code 
EVENT$250


Initiate a repeating direct deposit of $500+ your full pay, social security or pension into your account within 60 days of account opening




















The Fine Print

Checking account must remain open for 6 months or bonus will be forfeit




Avoiding Fees


This account does not have any monthly fees, they do require you to keep it open for six months to avoid any early account termination fee though.


Our Verdict


Might be worth doing if you live in the area due to the fact it’s a soft pull to open the account, but that will really depend if you’ve done all the better bonuses that are available already. For now we have added 
our best bonus list
, but towards the very bottom. Share your experiences with this bank and bonus in the comments below.

Says that Membership and account eligibility requirements must be met but it’s not clear what those actually are? According to the comments it doesn’t seem there are any.

City National Bank is offering a bonus of $200 when you open a new city checking account with direct deposit of $200 or more




 




The Fine Print




Bonus: Limited time offer. To earn the $200 direct deposit bonus, you must establish a qualified recurring direct deposit of $200 or more into the account.


The bonus will be deposited into the new account 91 days after account opening.


Limitations: The bonus cannot be used as the opening deposit.


Offer not available to existing checking account customers, those with fiduciary accounts or those whose account has been closed.


Limit 1 bonus per household.


All bank account bonuses are treated as income/interest and as such you have to pay taxes on them




Avoiding Fees


They offer a simply free checking account with no monthly fees to worry about. There is an early account termination fee of $25 if you close the account within 180 days.


Our Verdict


I generally don’t recommend $100 bonuses that must be opened in branch, but might be worth it for some if they live near a branch. Purely because it’s usually a lot of work for a $100 bonus that is also taxed. Because of this I won’t be adding it to 
our best bank bonus page

Open a new checking account with San Mateo Credit Union and receive a bonus of $150 when you meet the following requirements:



Earn $50* when making 10 or more debit card transactions monthly.


Earn $50* by having at least one monthly direct deposit, payroll deposit, or ACH transfer


Earn $50* by selecting eStatements each month










 


The Fine Print




Open a new San Mateo Credit Union (SMCU) Premium or Free Checking account (no other account types are eligible) from 4/1/19 – 5/31/19.


During the full calendar month immediately following the month in which the account is opened, initiate 10 or more PIN or Signature-based purchases or payments for at least $100 in spend using the SMCU debit card(s) associated with the new checking account.


ATM and ACH transactions are not eligible.


Offer is not available for existing SMCU members who have an open checking account as of 3/31/19. SMCU employees, affiliates, and their families are not eligible


Limit of one bonus-eligible checking account per individual and per mailing address.


Cash bonus for the month will be paid to the open, eligible checking account within 31 days after the qualification period ends. The account must have a positive balance at the time of payout to receive the bonus.


SMCU will classify the bonus as interest paid to the checking account where the bonus is credited. Any applicable taxes associated with the bonus are the responsibility of the SMCU account holder. To the extent required by law, SMCU will report the total value of this bonus to the IRS on Form 1099-INT for the tax year in which the bonus was paid.


In the case of a joint account, purchases and payments from multiple debit cards will be added together.




Avoiding Fees


Monthly Fees


They offer a free checking account with no monthly fee to worry about


Early Account Termination Fee


I wasn’t able to find a fee schedule so I’m unsure if an early account termination fee is charged or not.


Our Verdict


San Mateo has previously offered a $150 bonus but that required a total of 75 debit card transactions to be made
. Despite this offer being smaller I do think it’s better than the previous offer. Because the requirements for this bonus are easy to meet and there is no monthly fee to worry about, we will be adding this to our list of the 
best checking bonuses
.
